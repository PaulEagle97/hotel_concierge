# Digital Assistant

## How it works
Enables conversational experience with a Digital AI Concierge that has local knowledge and can perform actions.
First launch the hotel server, then the Chainlit app and talk to it as if you were to a real concierge.
Uses Open Source libraries like LLamaIndex (NLP Backend) and Chainlit(Chatbot Frontend).
