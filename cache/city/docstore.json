The cultural heritage of this city shaped by the Baroque has its origins in a vibrant exchange with its southern neighbors, especially Italy.\nSalzburg was very much a melting pot for the cultures and arts of northern and southern Europe. Even in early times, craftsmen and artists were drawn to Salzburg. Many of the baroque buildings were created by Italian architects such as Vincenzo Scamozzi and Santino Solari. There is very good reason why Salzburg is known as the \u201cRome of the North\u201d. This title can also be traced back to the special status once enjoyed by Salzburg: The archbishop of Salzburg was permitted to appoint his own bishops to his four subordinate bishoprics, just as the pope did elsewhere. And until 1806, he ruled over the second largest ecclesiastical state in the world. Only Rome was bigger. The city\u2019s sacred buildings captivate visitors from around the world with their baroque beauty. That said, the bourgeois homes of the Middle Ages and the broad, Italian-style plazas are likewise beautiful to look at. These sacred and secular buildings from different centuries have been preserved well, a major reason why Salzburg was added to the World Heritage List.\nThe historic city center of Salzburg: a walk through the centuries\nThe vibrant flair and special charm of Salzburg can best be experienced by taking a leisurely stroll through the historical downtown district. In fact, Salzburg\u2019s \u201cOld City\u201d lends itself perfectly to exploration on foot. The River Salzach actually divides it into two halves: the right side, including the Linzergasse, Platzl and Steingasse, and the left side. It is this left side, the older section of the city, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, also incorporating the Kaiviertel district as well as Festungsberg and M\u00f6nchsberg mountains. \nThe city mountains shape the face of the Old City, adding to its already captivating charm. Enthroned on the Festungsberg, high above Salzburg, is the emblem of this city, Hohensalzburg Fortress, built in the year 1077. You can either make your way up there on foot, or simply take a comfortable ride on the funicular. The left bank of the Salzach is also world famous for the Getreidegasse, where you will discover the house where Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born. The city owes much of its identity as a metropolis of music and the arts to this musical wunderkind. Though not only to him: In 1920, theater director and producer Max Reinhardt founded the Salzburg Festival, thereby underscoring Salzburg\u2019s reputation as an important center of the arts and culture. \nThe ultimate in culture: Mozart and the Salzburg Festival\nWhen the call to \u201cJedermann!\u201d echoes out over Cathedral Square, you know it\u2019s that time of year again: Festival season! It was on 22 August 1920 that Hugo von Hofmannsthal\u2019s play was first performed on Cathedral Square in Salzburg, directed by Max Reinhardt. However, the origins of the city\u2019s love for culture extend back much further.\nIn fact, it is generally assumed that the first opera ever performed north of the Alps was presented in Salzburg. The court of Salzburg\u2019s prince-archbishops also had a great appreciation for music and theater. Venues included Salzburg University as well as Salzburg Cathedral. Dramatic productions included everything from medieval mystery- and Passion plays to others with a popular appeal to the middle classes. The Salzburg Festival is regarded as one of the most important celebrations of opera, theater and art in the world today.\nAs you can see, Salzburg was already a city filled with culture and open to the arts when, on 27 January 1756, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart came into this world. In Salzburg\u2019s historical district, you will encounter traces of our wunderkind practically everywhere you go.

Alcohol taxes also brought in lucrative revenues for the state. At the time when Salzburg was absorbed into the Austrian crown lands, new production methods and improved technology led to an upswing in beer production. By 1860, there were 75 breweries across Salzburg City and the entire province. The war years of WWI and WWII saw a drastic decline in the brewing industry. From this point on, the Salzburg market was dominated by two major breweries: Stiegl and Kaltenhausen.\nBreweries in Salzburg\nSalzburg is generally regarded as the beer capital of Austria. Eleven breweries in and around the city reflect the impressive variety of opportunities available to beer aficionados.

Everyday wear for a woman was a plain cotton working dirndl, on feast-days and for church a festive costume of brocade, silk or velvet. With the emergence of tourism in the mid-19th century, together with the fashion for the summer retreat, traditional costume also became familiar in towns. It symbolised joie de vivre and the lightness of being, away from everyday life. This custom was enhanced after Max Reinhardt and Hugo von Hofmannsthal founded the Salzburg Festival, and it was considered chic to wear traditional costume \u2013 it was even worn on stage in Max Reinhardt's 1933 Faust production. The Sound of Music has made a huge contribution to familiarising the world with Salzburg's local costumes: whether at home or on stage, Maria Augusta von Trapp liked to wear a dirndl, and in both film and stage productions, dirndl, lederhosen and Haferlschuhe [robust working shoes] played an important role.\nProminent names continue to fill the order books of traditional businesses: Emperor Franz Joseph I, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Herbert von Karajan, Elizabeth Taylor, Billy Wilder, Pablo Picasso, Helmut Kohl, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Caroline von Monaco, Queen Beatrix, Placido Domingo, the Rothschild, Oppenheimer and Flick families, Louis Vuitton and many more famous names were or are avowed aficionados of traditional Salzburg fashion.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3414, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7ff8b15-37ac-498d-9cc5-ac5f965623aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7ff8b15-37ac-498d-9cc5-ac5f965623aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/winter"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1ec32216-b8aa-41a4-9f6e-528c4b438be9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/winter"}, "hash": "ab158f66c900dcfaff5a830b2c1eff54f5074ab11f1b182d9d8f4659f35a5cfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Salzburg has many different faces in winter: November and December are all about the preparations for Christmas.

The biggest fully preserved castle in Central Europe, this emblem of Salzburg, offers a 360-degree view of the city and its surroundings.\nThe History of Hohensalzburg Fortress\nArchbishop Gebhard built the Hohensalzburg Fortress in 1077. In the following years, his successors were responsible for the further development of the fortress architecture. Around 1500, under Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach, the fortress took on its present appearance. The original purpose of the fortress was to protect the principality and the archbishops from enemy attack. In all these years it has never been taken by foreign troops.\nThe Museums of Hohensalzburg Fortress \nHighlights include the fortress\u2019s many museums: The Fortress Museum itself shows historical exhibits focused on courtly life led by the prince archbishops; the Marionette Museum as well as the Museum of the Rainer Regiment likewise invite visitors to embark on a journey into the past. The historic armoury houses an interactive exhibition on suits of armour and weapons. Also located on the third floor of the fortress are the Princes\u2019 Chambers, consisting of the Princes\u2019 Hall, the Golden Chamber and the Golden Hall. The furnishings in all of these rooms are original and have remained unchanged since 1501/1502. Particularly impressive: a simulation of the night sky, consisting of gold stars on an azure and royal-blue background as well as the tile stove in the Golden Chamber.

The building, which is under a preservation order, borders on the Mozartplatz, Residenzplatz and Kaigasse, and today houses Salzburg Museum, Glockenspiel and Heimatwerk.\nHistory\nConstruction and completion of the New Residenz took more than a hundred years. Four prince-archbishops had considerable influence on its design, yet the building is essentially \"a child of the time\" of Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau. In 1588, he had the preceding buildings demolished to make room for the new one, intended to serve as his new residence and to accommodate guests. In 1605, however, he decided to retain the Old Residenz as his domicile. \nWolf Dietrich had the main building of the New Residenz completed with the tower, and began work on the wing next the Kaigasse, which was completed by his successor, Archbishop Markus Sittikus. In 1674, Archbishop Max Gandolph von Kuenburg built the south and south-west wing, intended mainly to house the court library. The arcades were added in the reign of Archbishop Johann Ernst Thun, and the tower heightened to accommodate the famous carillon (Glockenspiel). \nThe state-rooms\nThese splendid rooms on the second floor of the New Residenz comprise the Tugendsaal [virtue], Gloriensaal, St\u00e4ndesaal [estates], Feldherrensaal [commanders], bathroom and Bischofssaal. The richly stuccoed staircase is modelled on that of an Italian Renaissance palace. \nThe New Residenz today\nThe New Residenz now houses the following institutions: \nSalzburg Museum\nSalzburg Carillon\nSalzburger Heimatwerk\nCurrently, in co-operation with the Austrian Belvedere Gallery, work is in progress for the \"Belvedere Salzburg\" in the second inner courtyard of the New Residenz.

His successor, Marcus Sittikus, banished mother and children from the palace, which he re-named \"Schloss Mirabell\" [from the Italian mirabile \"wonderful\" and bella \"beautiful\"]. Eventually, under Prince-Archbishop Franz Anton Harrach, the site was reconstructed as a baroque palace complex. Especially worth a visit is the Marmorsaal [marble hall], formerly the prince-archbishop's banqueting hall, with its marble pillars, opulent stucco and ceiling frescos. Leading up to it is the \"angels' staircase\", created by the Austrian sculptor Georg Raphael Donner. The white marble balustrade is decorated with a host of putti. \nMirabell Palace today\nToday, the Mirabell Palace houses the offices of the Salzburg mayor and the municipal administration. The Marmorsaal is now considered one of the finest wedding halls in the world. Leopold Mozart and his children Wolfgang and Nannerl performed here. Besides hosting weddings, conferences and awards ceremonies, the Marmorsaal provides an enchanting setting for concerts. \nThe Mirabell Garden \u2013 a baroque pleasure garden in the town centre\nUnder Archbishop Johann Ernst Thun, the Mirabell Garden was reshaped around 1690 according to plans drawn up by baroque architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. The basic geometrical form characteristic of the Baroque age is still recognisable. The visual alignment towards Cathedral and Fortress lends the garden a grandiose effect, at the same time incorporating it into the historic townscape. \nFeatures of special interest in the Mirabell Garden\nThe large parterre with the central fountain and the four groups of figures by Ottavio Mosto, symbolising the four elements: fire, air, earth and water. \nThe small parterre with the Pegasus fountain. The copper Pegasus figure, forged in 1661 by Caspar Gras, was commissioned by Archbishop Guidobald von Thun for a horse-pond on the Kapitelplatz. After gracing several different squares in the Old Town, the famous sculpture was placed here in 1913. \nThe Heckentheater [hedge theatre] in the western section of the garden \u2013 one of the oldest hedge theatres north of the Alps. Folkloric and other events are held here in summer. \nThe Zwergerlgarten [dwarf garden] dates from the reign of Archbishop Johann Ernst Graf Thun. Originally comprising 28 dwarfs of white Untersberg marble, it is the oldest dwarf garden in Europe. 17 of the original dwarfs are still preserved. \nThe Mirabell Garden as a famous film location\nBesides the Felsenreitschule and the Nonnberg convent, the Mirabell Garden is one of the principal settings in the Hollywood musical The Sound of Music. In the film, Maria and the children dance around the Pegasus fountain behind Mirabell Palace, singing the song \"Do-Re-Mi\". At the end of this scene, the Trapp family line up on the steps leading to the Rosenh\u00fcgel [rose hill] for the finale. The unique view through the Mirabell Garden to the Palace has since become world-famous.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3141, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5efa040d-6a2a-475d-9ac6-78fc222c1448": {"__data__": {"id_": "5efa040d-6a2a-475d-9ac6-78fc222c1448", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/fortress-palaces/leopoldskron-palace"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "050954e9-3140-49ef-a3b7-7339bf13c947", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/fortress-palaces/leopoldskron-palace"}, "hash": "a44176686bdad2c8e705fab39213b0bb75beb0873a8fb7c9eb7322733cf2e7a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Fortress & Palaces\nLeopoldskron Palace\nLeopoldskron Palace\nPicturesquely situated Schloss Leopoldskron lies just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the Salzburg historical district, the world-famous former family seat of one of the prince-archbishops as well as an original shooting location from the movie \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d. \nResidence of the Prince-Archbishop\nIn 1736, Salzburg prince-archbishop Leopold Anton Freiherr von Firmian built Schloss Leopoldskron as the family residence. Standing right next to the beautiful Leopoldskron Pond, it captivates with panoramic views of the surrounding mountain world. Because of his special ties to the palace, the prince-archbishop had his heart interred in the chapel of Schloss Leopoldskron.\nMax Reinhardt and his estate\nEurope\u2019s most famous theater impresario, Max Reinhardt, purchased Schloss Leopoldskron in 1918. Over the course of 20 years, he restored this jewel of the Baroque to renewed glory. In those days, the palace also served as an international, high-profile meeting place for the artistic and cultural scene. Furthermore, it was here that Max Reinhardt, together with Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss, founded the Salzburg Festival.\nSchloss Leopoldskron as a movie set\nSince 1965, Schloss Leopoldskron has been well known far beyond Austria\u2019s borders as an original shooting location for the world-famous movie \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d. Nowadays, it is a stopping point on many guided tours of the city, enchanting visitors with its rich history as well as its magical location. It should be noted that admission to the palace, the park grounds and its historic landmarks is restricted solely to invited guests and customers of the house.\nThe palace as an event location and holiday refuge \nToday\u2019s Schloss Leopoldskron offers the opportunity to reside during your Salzburg visit in a truly idyllic setting on the outskirts of the city. Secluded behind the historic walls of this former princely residence are luxurious suites and rooms with an exclusive charm all their own. State-of-the-art technology, functional room amenities and personal service make Schloss Leopoldskron a popular year-round seminar- and event location for very special private as well as professional occasions.\nSchloss Leopoldskron: Cradle of the Salzburg Festival\nAccessibility \nHotel Schloss Leopoldskron is generally accessible for guests with reduced mobility. Please note, however, that the historic infrastructure may provide minor obstacles, such as door steps, uneven floors, or tight paths, which may be challenging to overcome without help. The staff will be glad to help as needed. \nImpressions\nLeopoldskron Palace and the Fortress Hohensalzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nLeopoldskron Palace and the Fortress Hohensalzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nLeopoldskron Palace in the Winter | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \nLeopoldskron Palace in the Winter | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \n'marble hall' | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \n'marble hall' | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \nchinese Salon | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \nchinese Salon | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \nvenetian Salon | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \nvenetian Salon | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \nLeopoldskron Palace in autumn | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \nLeopoldskron Palace in autumn | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \nsecret stairway | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \nsecret stairway | \u00a9 Schloss Leopoldskron \nLeopoldskron Palace and the Fortress Hohensalzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nLeopoldskron Palace and the Fortress Hohensalzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nContact\nSchloss Leopoldskron\nLeopoldskronstra\u00dfe 56-58\n5020 Salzburg \nTel. +43662 83983-0 \nConsent for missing marketing cookies", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3627, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86ed6d09-6dd9-4667-b979-8f1f43b29695": {"__data__": {"id_": "86ed6d09-6dd9-4667-b979-8f1f43b29695", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/churches-cemeteries/st-peters-monastery-cemetery"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a74b4ad7-7eeb-4c93-a65e-bc63857b2220", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/churches-cemeteries/st-peters-monastery-cemetery"}, "hash": "e9e37f1cb7278a17a549162813b121b7324ab3cd7c4ad211aeabecfc2148e763", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "abb44b70-015c-4476-8c16-db73c961a71a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f978d9657be85e77b0ede8fff77edb132be4ceda7b9034c846246651b7f2d93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Churches & Cemeteries\nSt. Peter's Monastery & Cemetery\nSt. Peter's Abbey was founded in the 7th century and is considered the oldest monastery still in existence in the German-speaking world. Along with the impressive Christian architecture, St. Peter's cemetery and the catacombs are a popular tourist attraction in Salzburg.\nSt. Peter's collegiate church and monastery\nThe first Abbey Church of St. Peter was built in 696 by Rupert, Bishop of Worms. Today's Abbey Church was built in the 12th century and remodelled several times over the centuries, and today combines elements of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo styles. The historic main organ and the various chapels are particularly interesting. The museum of St. Peter and the Long Gallery are accessible via the DomQuartier. \nSt Peter's Cemetery and Catacombs\nSt Peter's Cemetery was built in late antiquity and is therefore older than the archabbey itself. Numerous funerary monuments and crypts around the late-Gothic Margarethenkapelle in the centre of the grounds make St Peter's Cemetery so impressive. Famous personalities, artists, scholars and merchants found their final resting place here. The catacombs are caves carved into the fortress hill. They are most likely of late antique-early Christian origin and did not serve as burial sites but as early Christian meeting places. International visitors recognise the cemetery and catacombs as familiar settings from the film The Sound of Music. \nMusic in St. Peter's Abbey\nMozart and Hayden are closely associated with St. Peter's Abbey. In 1769, thirteen-year-old Mozart composed the Dominicus mass for the abbot and a few years later Michael Haydn wrote the Rupertus mass commissioned by the abbey. Today, the Baroque Hall in St. Peter's Stiftskulinarium restaurant and the Romanesque Hall are regularly used for concert events such as the Mozart Dinner Concert. \nBusiness enterprises\nIn keeping with Benedictine tradition, the Archabbey of St. Peter also has several businesses. The St. Peter's Abbey Bakery and the St. Peter's Stiftskulinarium are well worth a visit. \nOpening times \nCatacombs:\nMay-September: daily 10 am-12:30 pm, 1 pm-6 pm \nOctober-April: daily 10 am-12:30 pm, 1 pm-5 pm \n(last admission 20 min. before closing) \nClosed: 1 Jan, 24-26 Dec, 31 Dec\nAlterations possible, please see notice \nDogs not permitted\nAbbey Church of St. Peter:\nDaily 8 am-8 pm\nNo visits during mass!\nSt. Peter Cemetery:\nApril-September 6:30 am-8 pm\nOctober-March 6:30 am-6 pm\n(Status: 11/2024)\nPrices \nCatacombs: \nAdults \u20ac 2.00 \nChildren/youths (6-18 years) \u20ac 1.50 \nGroups of 10 adults or more, per person \u20ac 1.50 \nSchool groups, per pupil \u20ac 1.00\nSalzburgCard: one time free admission \n(Status: 11/2024)\nAccessibility \nBarrier-free access to the church to the left of the main entrance, door can be opened with a Euro-Key.

Both houses of worship are remarkable because of their striking contrasts: on the one hand the cathedral, the dominating baroque church of the bishops, on the other the Franciscan Church, a slender Gothic church of the common citizenry; the cathedral, a structure intended to embody the stature of the church as an institution, and the Franciscan Church, a site for silent contemplation. \nConstruction History\nThe Franciscan Church is presumably even older than the cathedral, its construction ascribed to St. Virgil. And like practically all of Salzburg's houses of worship, it was also ravaged by fire. Its reconstruction at the turn of the 12th century also served as a symbol of Salzburg's emergent merchant sector, further amplified at the beginning of the 15th century, when the self-confident middle classes possessed the means to renovate the church. The magnificent hall chancel is an architectural masterpiece, creating the imposing contrast between light and dark which makes the Franciscan Church so unique.\nThe Treasures of the Church Interior\nThe high altar, designed in 1709/1710 by Fischer von Erlach, contains a \"Madonna with Child\" by Michael Pacher. Over the years, the ruling archbishops undertook various alterations to the Franciscan Church, including the addition of a connecting walkway to the Residenz installed by Wolf Dietrich. The interior features nine different chapels, four of which were endowed by different archbishops.\nLasting Impressions: The \"Hand of Refuge\"\nThe Franciscan Church doesn't merely unite different styles ranging from Romanesque to modern, it also possesses countless impressive details. For example, its big church bell, the Marienglocke, plays an important supporting role in summer performances of \"Jedermann\" on the Cathedral Square. And to the lower right of the entrance door, we find the \"Hand of Refuge\".

Built by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, it looks back on an exciting history and has gained a reputation in the City of Mozart as a venue for art and music. \nLasting Impressions: Church of Light\nThe exceptionally steep dimensions of the church interior are very impressive. By foregoing painting and very sparing use of stucco and sculptures, the space achieves its own distinctive effect. This simplicity is an ideal backdrop for art exhibitions and concerts. And if you look closely, you might well discover a scorch mark on the marble flooring. This comes from the time when Salzburg was occupied by Napoleonic troops and the church was used as a warehouse for hay. \nConstruction History\nThe Collegiate Church was built under Archbishop Johann Ernst Graf Thun as a new house of worship for the Benedictine university, which had been established in 1620. In order to oversee the project, the archbishop selected probably the most important baroque architect of that time, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. In building the University Church, Fischer von Erlach created his masterpiece. The consecration ceremonies began on 20 November 1707 and lasted eight days. The artist himself was sadly no longer able to see \"the crown of his creations\", since he had gone blind in the meantime. The chapels within the church's interior are dedicated to the patron saints of the four academic faculties: Thomas Aquinus (theology), Ivo (law), Luke (medicine) and Catharine (philosophy).\nA church with a rich history and countless stories to tell\nOver the years, the University Church was to experience a checkered history. When the troops of Napoleon's army occupied the city in 1800, the church was used as a hay depot. In 1810 \u2013 when Salzburg came under Bavarian rule \u2013 the University was closed and the church's original purpose was lost. During the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, it served both as a grammar school and as a church for the military. In 1922, the first performance of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's \"Grosses Welttheater\" took place here. With the official reopening of Salzburg University in 1964, the church was restored to its original purpose. Today, it also serves as a venue for art installations as well as concerts. \nThe Collegiate Church provides barrier-free access. The barrier-free entrance is to the right of the main entrance, via the passage to the Furtw\u00e4nglerpark, accessible with the Euro-Key.

Today, the Residenz can be visited on a tour of the DomQuartier, and provides a unique setting for events.\nHistory\nAn episcopal residence was first documented in the area of today's Residenz around 1120. This mediaeval episcopal seat was extended several times before being demolished by Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich to make way for a new, Italianate building. Subsequent prince-archbishops, with the best architects and artisans of the time, continued to furnish the Residenz in magnificent style, and from this centre they directed the fortunes of the principality. In those days, the Residenz was of great cultural importance. The state-rooms were used for theatre and concert performances and for grand receptions. In 1614, the Carabinierisaal was the scene of the first opera performance north of the Alps. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, aged seven, gave his first court recital in the conference room, and some of his early works were premi\u00e8red in his presence in the Rittersaal. \nAfter the secularisation of the Prince-Archbishopric in 1803, the Old Residenz was used by the Habsburgs. It was in the Rittersaal that, on 1 May 1816, Emperor Franz I received the homage and the oath of allegiance of the Salzburg estates \u2013 which marked the beginning of Salzburg's affiliation to Austria. On his visits to Salzburg, Emperor Franz Joseph also stayed in the Residenz, where he received the (later) German Emperor Wilhelm I in 1865 and Emperor Napoleon III of France in 1867, on state visits. \nThe Residenz today\nThe Salzburg Residenz has been in the possession of the Province of Salzburg since 1974. The state-rooms and the Residenzgalerie (founded in 1955) with its collection of 16th-19th-century European paintings can be visited as part of the DomQuartier tour. In addition, receptions, conferences and international congresses are held in the Residenz. The Toscana wing in the north section of the building now houses the Law Faculty of Salzburg University.\nEvents \nMozart violin sonatas at Salzburg Residenz Palace 09.11.2024\nMozart violin sonatas at Salzburg Residenz Palace 10.11.2024\nMozart violin sonatas at Salzburg Residenz Palace 11.11.2024\nMozart violin sonatas at Salzburg Residenz Palace 12.11.2024\nMozart violin sonatas at Salzburg Residenz Palace 13.11.2024\nMozart violin sonatas at Salzburg Residenz Palace 14.11.2024\nMozart violin sonatas at Salzburg Residenz Palace 15.11.2024\nMozart violin sonatas at Salzburg Residenz Palace 16.11.2024\nMozart violin sonatas at Salzburg Residenz Palace 17.11.2024\nMozart violin sonatas at Salzburg Residenz Palace 18.11.2024\nLinks\nCarabinierisaal | \u00a9 DomQuartier Salzburg \nCarabinierisaal | \u00a9 DomQuartier Salzburg \nRittersaal | \u00a9 DomQuartier Salzburg \nRittersaal | \u00a9 DomQuartier Salzburg \nKonferenzzimmer | \u00a9 DomQuartier Salzburg \nKonferenzzimmer | \u00a9 DomQuartier Salzburg \nInnenhof der Residenz | \u00a9 DomQuartier Salzburg \nInnenhof der Residenz | \u00a9 DomQuartier Salzburg \nOld Residence Salzburg | \u00a9 Agentur Orheus/Foto Sulzer \nOld Residence Salzburg | \u00a9 Agentur Orheus/Foto Sulzer \nResidenz zu Salzburg\nDomQuartier Salzburg, Residenzplatz 1\nTel. +43 662 8042-2109", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3322, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93864cec-6617-48af-9bcf-9e38dc10cef1": {"__data__": {"id_": "93864cec-6617-48af-9bcf-9e38dc10cef1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/green-salzburg/untersberg"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39f754c4-3ff2-4d43-b11a-70b74cde1e49", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/green-salzburg/untersberg"}, "hash": "dafe1ed554cdeb8cc7d0352498248ae51d9dfbeda2e4013b1c9eb5109c8f1c7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Untersberg in figures \nThe Untersberg covers an area of 70 km2 \u2013 one third lying in Austria, two thirds in Bavaria, Germany. A cable car runs from Gr\u00f6dig/St. Leonhard to the south of Salzburg up to the Geiereck top station at 1,776 m altitude. At its highest point, the Untersberg measures 1,972 metres. \nWithin the Untersberg are many caves, mostly inaccessible, which have given rise to fascinating myths and legends. The Untersberg Museum in F\u00fcrstenbrunn shows where the famous Unterberg marble is quarried and how it is used in industry. The Untersberg offers special power spots, where the visitor may be endowed with refreshing or healing energy. The Dalai Lama called the Salzburg mountain \"the chakra at the heart of Europe\".\nThe Untersberg as recreational space \nFor sports enthusiasts, the Untersberg is a real paradise, whatever the season In summer, hikers and mountain-bikers have a wide choice of routes. In winter, the snow-covered mountain offers a 7.5km-long ski-run designed to gladden the hearts of skiers and snowboarders. Ski tourers appreciate the tranquillity of the unspoilt landscape away from the ski-runs. The entire mountain is a landscape and plant conservation region, one area is declared a water protection zone. Most of the town of Salzburg gets its drinking water from the Untersberg. \nTravel and catering \nThe bottom station in Gr\u00f6dig/St. Leonhard, about 10 km south of Salzburg, can easily be reached by bus (nos. 25 and 28) and trolley bus line 5.

Here, there is much to discover: the baptismal font, the crypt, the art installation \"Vanitas\", as well as the chest containing relics of the Saints Rupert and Virgil. In addition, many secrets are associated with the seven bells as well as the three entrance doors. If you take a closer look, you will even find 370-year-old graffiti scratched into the marble portal. \nConserving history. \nThe cathedral is a monument that needs protection and care. For that reason, a conservation fee of EUR 5,00 is collected for visiting the church (children and adolescents up to 18 free). Included in that ticket is a wide range of possibilities to experience the cathedral: audio guides and daily tours open new perspectives and during \u201cMusik zu Mittag\u201d (music at lunchtime), visitors can listen to the sound of organs that also Mozart played. \nMagnificent Cathedral Architecture\nSalzburg Cathedral is an imposing tribute to the Early Baroque. Visitors are greeted by the resplendent fa\u00e7ade made of Untersberg Marble. Looking down from it are four monumental statues: Apostles Peter and Paul holding a key and a sword, as well as Salzburg's two patron saints, Rupert and Virgil, clasping a salt vessel and a model of the church. The two escutcheons at the top of the gable commemorate the two builders of the cathedral, Markus Sittikus and Paris Lodron. The Cathedral Square, with a statue of the Virgin Mary, forms the atrium \u2013 serving as the imposing backdrop for the performances of Jedermann during the Salzburg Festival as well as for the beloved Christmas Market.\nThe Treasures of Salzburg Cathedral\nThe many treasures of this cathedral include a bronze baptismal font (1311) with lions at its base (1200), in which Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Mohr, the man who wrote the words for \"Silent Night!\", were both christened. Other highlights include the imposing main organ, the cathedral gates by Schneider-Manzell, Matar\u00e9 and Manz\u00fa, as well as seven bells. The three gates stand for Faith, Love and Hope, with the middle gate (for Love) somewhat larger. The seven bells also have names, ranging from Salvator (the biggest) to Barbara (the smallest). In the Cathedral Museum, you can gaze on other art treasures plucked from 1300 years of church history. \nSalzburg Cathedral and its Rulers\nThe history of Salzburg Cathedral is closely intertwined with that of its rulers, the prince-archbishops. The cathedral was destroyed by a number of fires, then rebuilt and expanded. The years displayed on the wrought-iron gates \u2013 774, 1628 and 1959 \u2013 recall the three occasions the cathedral was consecrated.\nIts Medieval Predecessors \nThe very first cathedral was built in 767 under bishop Virgil, subsequently consecrated to Saints Peter and Rupert in the year 774. After a fire in 1167, archbishop Konrad III had the cathedral rebuilt, now more magnificent than ever, with the work completed in just ten years: now the mightiest Romanesque minster north of the Alps. The remains of these two former churches can still be viewed in the cathedral crypt.\nThe Newer Early Baroque Cathedral \nYet another fire destroyed major sections of the cathedral in 1598. Archbishop Wolf Dietrich was rather unfocused in tackling the rebuilding efforts. Only after his imprisonment and death was his successor Markus Sittikus able to complete the project. He commissioned Santino Solari to build the first example of Early Baroque sacred architecture north of the Alps. The new cathedral was finally consecrated by Archbishop Paris Lodron in 1628. In 1944, an aircraft bomb damaged the dome as well as parts of the sanctuary. In 1959, Salzburg Cathedral was finally re-consecrated, now as magnificent as ever.

The square was known as Ludwig Victor Square between 1873 and 1927 after Archduke Ludwig Viktor, the youngest brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I, who moved to Klessheim Palace in 1861. \nOldest weekly market\nThe dairy market, herb market, turnip/cabbage market and the stove fitters' market were once linked to the central market. The square is enclosed by a row of stately town houses, whose core often dates back to the Middle Ages. \nThe Old Marketplace was not only used as a weekly market but also served as a festive setting for the Whitsun dance, the sword dance by the D\u00fcrrnberg miners, St. John's fire during the midsummer festival and the annual dance by barefoot bakers. The Old Marketplace also served as a venue for the annual Lent market until 1889. It spread to University Square and Residence Square after 1813 and was used for an autumn market until 1856, also known as St. Rupert's Market. The weekly market moved to present-day University Square in 1857.\nSt. Florian Fountain\nThe market fountain is located in the center of the Old Marketplace. It was built in 1488 to replace the former ornamental fountain. Its octagonal basin was built from 1685 to 1687 and is surrounded by two marble steps. Its corner columns are decorated with acanthus and rosettes as well as an intricate scrollwork grill resting on the water basin, crafted by Wolf Guppenberger in 1583. The town of Salzburg's coat of arms can be found on the fountain column and wrought iron grill. The statue of St. Florian von Lorch at the top of the fountain column was sculpted by Josef Anton Pfaffinger in 1734. \nThe buildings and their history\nToday the Old Marketplace boasts an impressive row of town houses whose core often dates back to the Middle Ages, although overlaid by early modern architecture. \nThe smallest house in Salzburg's historic city center is a rare curiosity. At a width of only 1.42 meters, it is located next to the famous Tomaselli coffeehouse. The tiny house was built to close a narrow alley between 1830 and 1860. \nThe old archiepiscopal apothecary has been located on Alter Markt since the end of the 16th century. The traditional coffeehouse, Caf\u00e9 Tomaselli, and Caf\u00e9-Konditorei F\u00fcrst, whose founder invented the Mozart-Kugel chocolates, are located across from the Old Residence.\nAlter Markt | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg/ G.Breitegger \nAlter Markt | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg/ G.Breitegger \nAlter Markt in Salzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg / S.

It was bought in 1690 by Archbishop Johann Ernst Graf Thun, who soon began the construction of a pleasure palace to be known as the \u201cFavorita\u201d, according to the plans of the famous architect Fischer von Erlach. However, Prince-Archbishop Thun died in 1709 and work on the palace came to a halt. It was not until the reign of Prince-Archbishop Leopold Anton von Firmian, who also commissioned the construction of Schloss Leopoldskron, that Schloss Klessheim was completed. \nA pleasure palace in the truest sense \nThe exterior of Schloss Klessheim captivates above all with its gardens and the magnificent Triton Fountain. The plinths at the top of the main driveway are decorated with recumbent stags, their antlers studded with golden stars invoking the official crest of Prince-Archbishop Firmian himself. Aside from the baroque entranceway and the staircase, the grand banquet hall with its high dome and various examples of stuccowork is particularly worthy of note.\nKavalierhaus and Garden \nDuring the period of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, the palace was owned by Archduke Ludwig Viktor. He commissioned architect Heinrich von Ferstel to build a winter palace, that would become known as the \u201cKavalierhaus\u201d. The Kavalierhaus and the main palace are connected by a tree-lined avenue. The spacious gardens feature a high wall as well as 11 small guardhouses. The visual division of the grounds into the Meierhofgarten, the \u201cOrnamental Garden\u201d and the \u201cPheasant Garden\u201d was achieved by means of wall which stands to this day. \nSchloss Klessheim in recent history \nDuring the days of the Third Reich, Schloss Klessheim was the site of numerous parades and displays of weaponry. After the Allies\u2019 victory, it became the headquarters of the military authorities. Since 1993, Casino Salzburg has resided in the magnificent rooms of Schloss Klessheim. Guests are captivated by the special flair of the casino, its unique interplay of baroque art and the modern world of \u201cgames of chance\u201d.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2112, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5544a6a-6fbb-4fe1-bcdb-066f4e606242": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5544a6a-6fbb-4fe1-bcdb-066f4e606242", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/excursions/salzburg-open-air-museum"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "08ae2280-4cd0-40f9-871a-a2133578d0e5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/excursions/salzburg-open-air-museum"}, "hash": "03fedfd31ab9fb35ef3a2a1f9737c08af8be3256a11522b417a3e067b01ec0bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "16bd141a-c54d-44a0-b27a-b7370e85d44c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "38c1feb93d24060fbdc9a6aafab7622525c20449d15888d9982ab0fa5c6303f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Excursions\nSalzburg Open Air Museum\nSituated in the heart of the Untersberg Nature Park near the city of Salzburg, the 50-hectare Salzburg Open Air Museum documents rural building, living and farming in the Salzburg region from the 16th to the 20th century.\nA museum sure to astonish you\nHere, just outside Salzburg, visitors are able to experience authentic farmhouses, the homes of craftsmen, mills, barns, a smithy and even a sawmill. In total, the Open-Air Museum presents over 100 real buildings, spread across 5 distinct areas representing each of Salzburger Land\u2019s different regions. Demonstrations of a wide range of traditional crafts as well as seasonal folk events (including an Easter market, raising of the Maypole etc.) turn any visit to the museum into a truly interactive experience.\nEnjoyment for Young and Old\nIf you prefer not to explore all of the 50 hectares on foot, you can simply hop aboard for a comfortable ride on the two kilometers-long historic museum railway, with three stops along the way. Yet another highlight of the Open-Air Museum is a tractor exhibition including multimedia displays and even a play tractor for kids to climb on and explore. Whenever the hunger in your tummy overcomes your hunger for knowledge, we suggest stopping by the \u201cSalettl\u201d, the museum\u2019s own restaurant serving a delicious selection of popular dishes.

In addition, the old houses are often decorated with important dates in their history, the names of former owners and even the eye of God. Yet another magnet for visitors is Mozart's Birthplace, which stands at No. 9 Getreidegasse. Salzburg's immortal wunderkind was born here back in 1756.\nThe Through-Houses of the Getreidegasse\nThrough-houses are very typical of the Salzburg historical district. The front and back of the buildings let directly out onto different streets, with an arcaded passageway connecting the two. Today, they often also feature artworks, art galleries and shops. The most famous of these is at the Schatz House, leading from No. 3 Getreidegasse to University Square. There, in a dark corner, you will encounter a poignant relief depicting the Madonna with the infant Jesus.\nThe Getreidegasse \u2013 a street for pleasant strolls and Shopping expeditions\nAbove all, the Getreidegasse draws visitors with its wide selection of international fashion chains, traditional shops and a broad range of dining opportunities. Aside from jewelry, folkwear, trendy accessories, antiquities, leather goods, stationery and perfume shops, avid shoppers can also pick up groceries and deli products in the Getreidegasse. A particular highlight of this street are its ornamental and often quite elaborate guild signs protruding from the building facades, high above pedestrians\u2019 heads. The Wieber shop in the Getreidegasse is a traditional metalworking business which, among other things, still manufactures these \u201cadvertising signs\u201d by hand.\nThe Name of the Getreidegasse\n\u201cGetreide\u201d is the German word for \u201cgrain\u201d. That said, the name of this particular street actually has nothing to do with grain. In fact, it was originally called the Trabe-, Trab- or Trav-Gasse, with those names representing older forms of the verb \u201ctraben\u201d, meaning to trot or lope along. Over the course of many years, the names Tragasse, Traidgasse and Getreidgasse gradually mutated into the Getreidegasse we are familiar with today.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2221, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76e9c907-1f58-4568-97e9-085e5e6b1ee6": {"__data__": {"id_": "76e9c907-1f58-4568-97e9-085e5e6b1ee6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/squares-streets/domplatz-marienstatue"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fd6312ba-d50c-4d61-8dcf-b1f82371770b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/squares-streets/domplatz-marienstatue"}, "hash": "2697670b1d6ac575954fec4eeecef02969f8009cf778e21dabc02e2a17c55b49", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Squares & Streets\nDomplatz & Marienstatue\nThe grand Cathedral Square lies directly in front of Salzburg Cathedral, in the heart of the baroque historic district. The statue of the Virgin Mary enthroned upon the square was built out of lead and marble in the 18th century.\nCathedral square description\nArchbishop Wolf Dietrich was the power behind the construction of the Cathedral Square. It is characterized by its architectural unity and exceptional beauty. Standing right on the square are the Cathedral itself, the Residenz (official residence of the prince-archbishops) and one wing of St. Peter's Monastery. This square connects to two other famous city squares, the Residenzplatz and Kapitelplatz, as well as through various arcades to the Franziskanergasse.\nStatue of the Virgin Mary\nIn this case, the statue of Immaculata, the Virgin Mary, was commissioned by Archbishop Sigismund Graf Schrattenbach. Between 1766 and 1771, brothers Wolfgang and Johann Baptist Hagenauer created the figure, a combination of sculpted marble and cast lead. This statue was clearly influenced by other statues of the Virgin Mary located in Vienna and Munich.\nWhen viewed from the center of the arcades of the Franziskanergasse, the classicist column is positioned in the central axis of the cathedral and shows the Virgin Mary surrounded by the angels on the cathedral fa\u00e7ade and seems to wear the crown mounted on the building.\nCathedral Square today\nDue to its self-contained form, Cathedral Square has proven itself as the ideal venue for performances of the famous \"Jedermann\" morality play by Hugo von Hofmannsthal during the Salzburg Festival. During the summer months, the stage and audience grandstand invite you to enjoy a pleasant break amid the bustling historic district. In winter, the Salzburg Christkindlmarkt is held here, while autumn treats us to a series of events including Ruperkirtag.\nDetail of Marian Pillar in front of the Cathedral | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg / S.

Setting out from the \"Platzl\", a small square adjacent to the Staatsbr\u00fccke bridge, this street runs parallel to the Kapuzinerberg out as far as Schallmoos. One-of-a-kind boutiques, fine restaurants and traditional hotels invite passersby to stop along the way.\nThe history of the Linzergasse\nSince Roman times, the Linzer Gasse has served as a main thoroughfare on the far side of the Old Town, and was once the most important road for travelers making their way out of Salzburg in the direction of Linz, Vienna and the northeastern lands of the Habsburg Empire. Although the catastrophic city fire of 1818 showed no mercy to the 14th and 15th century houses on the Linzer Gasse, it was later possible to restore its historic merchants' homes almost in their entirety. The focus of the Linzer Gasse has practically always been on traditional craftsmanship and artistry. A few years ago, a number of international fashion chains also became established here. \nFamous personalities\nAs a vibrant Shopping street, the Linzer Gasse has attracted many a famous personality. At no.3, for example, none less than the famous physician and scientist Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, better known as Paracelsus, lived from 1540 until 1541. Located at Linzergasse no. 7 since 1809 is the Engel Apotheke, whose most prominent pharmacy assistant was poet Georg Trakl, born in Salzburg in 1887. Right next door, at no.9, is Hotel Gablerbr\u00e4u, where a memorial plaque commemorates the great singer Richard Mayr. \nHighlights of the Linzer Gasse \nStarting out from the Linzer Gasse, an imposing old gate and stairway lead us past the Stations of the Cross up the Kapuzinerberg. Once at the top, we are rewarded with incomparable views out across the entire Salzburg historical district. However, if you decide not to take this detour up the Kapuzinerberg, a visit to St. Sebastian's Cemetery is highly recommended. This picturesque secluded treasure, located in the upper section of the Linzer Gasse, was actually commissioned by Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich, intended to evoke the style of an Italian \"Campo Santo\".\nLinzer Gasse | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg / S.

However, the church will be open without restrictions.\nBenedictine Nonnberg Abbey lies a little above the city at the foot of the Festungsberg and is famous for its Gothic architectural elements and its murals and smaller works of art. It is also here that the story told in the Hollywood production of \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d begins. Widely unkown is the fact that the nuns sing Gregorian Chorals every morning.\nChurch experience \nEvery morning at 6:45 am and in the evening (for detailed information, please refer to the opening hours), Nonnberg Abbey Church is filled with the sound of the nuns' choir.\nThe history of Nonnberg Abbey \nNonnberg Abbey was founded between 711-715. The early history of the convent's construction is unclear. What is known, however, is that Emperor Henry II built a Romanesque basilica around the turn of the millennium, which was consecrated to the Holy Mother of God in 1009 and has since then been the second oldest Marian church in Salzburg. Erentrudis of Salzburg was the first abbess of the Benedictine abbey. Since 1624 she has held the title of \"Landesmutter Salzburgs\" [Mother of Salzburg] and her tomb is in the crypt of Marian church. \nThe architecture through the ages \nThe architecture of the abbey is characterised by the spirit of the Gothic period, which can be clearly seen in the abundance of the rich ornamentation. The late Gothic winged altar with the statue of Mary is the centrepiece of the abbey church. Unique in Salzburg is the crypt with its free-standing columns and magnificent reticulated vault. The tomb of St. Erentrudis is in the apse. The convent is home to a crucifix from the old cathedral dating from 1300, and the famous wall paintings from the mid-12th century are the church's greatest treasure. \nNonnberg Abbey as a Hollywood model \nThe monastery gained international fame through its novice Maria Kutschera. Her abbess sent her to be a governess to the widowed Baron Georg Ritter von Trapp to look after his seven children. Shortly afterwards, Maria married the baron and founded a family choir in the early 1930s. Her story served as the model for the world-famous Hollywood film \"The Sound of Music\" and still inspires visitors from all over the world today. \nA visit to Nonnberg Abbey \nThe monastery can be reached from Kaigasse via the Nonnbergstiege staircase and from Nonntal via a narrow lane. The church as well as the cemetery are open daily from 6.45 am until nightfall (in summer until 6 pm). Visits are not possible during church services.

The statue was to be erected in 1841 on the 50th anniversary of W. A. Mozart's death. However, the unveiling of the monument was delayed by a year because a Roman mosaic had been found in the ground, which took time to recover. On 4 September 1842, the statue was ceremoniously unveiled in the presence of Mozart's sons. The Bavarian King Ludwig I was an important sponsor of the Mozart statue and donated the marble pedestal.

Since it is a protected natural monument, development of the cave has been painstakingly cautious in order to preserve its unique natural beauty and ecosystem.\nFascinating World of Ice\nStepping through the imposing cave entrance, 20 meters wide and 18 high, you enter a mysterious world of ice. Aside from its enormous dimensions, the cave impresses with its ice palaces of crystalline beauty. Monumental formations glisten to amazing effect in the light of the traditional mine lamps which are issued to visitors. Winding passageways and galleries with evocative names such \"Diamond Realm\" lead you deeper and deeper into the mountain.\nGuided Cave Tours \nThe Ice Caves can only be visited as part of guided tours offered from May to October. These 75-minute tours include scientific information and historical facts about the cave. Especially on hot summer days, you will find yourself immerged in what is essentially a parallel world of ice. Incidentally, on clear days you will be able stand at the cave entrance and look out at a magnificent mountain panorama in front of you.\nRide up on Austria\u2019s steepest gondola lift\nYou can in fact hike from the visitor center in the valley all the way up to the ice caves in the Tennengebirge mountains.

Appropriate clothing and shoes are a must - and you need to be in fairly good physical condition: In the cave itself, you will have to cope with a total vertical gain of around 234 meters, which includes a countless number of stairs.

It is bordered by the New Residence with its carillon, the Cathedral, the Old Residence and a continuous row of townhouses.\nHistory\nFive squares were built under Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau: Residence Square with its richly decorated baroque fountain is probably the largest and most beautiful square. Fifty-five medieval buildings were torn down to make room for the square. Residence Square was designed according to the Mannerist plans of the Italian architect, Vincenzo Scamozzi.\nResidence Fountain\nResidence Fountain is considered to be the most beautiful fountain in the city of Salzburg and certainly deserves a closer look: four snorting horses seem to spring forth from the spouting rock. Giants rooted in the rock carry the lower basin, in which three dolphins balance the scalloped upper basin. The upper basin holds a Triton, a jet of water shooting into the air from his conch-shell trumpet. \nArchbishop Guidobald Thun, a fountain enthusiast, commissioned the fountain to be built. It is considered to be one of the most significant baroque monuments in Europe today. The work is attributed to the Italian sculptor, Tommaso di Garone.\nResidence Square today\nResidence Square is a popular venue for big sports or music events, including public airings of football games, live concerts and New Year's Eve parties. Residence Square serves as the setting for St. Rupert's Fair in September and a Christmas market during the Advent season. For fans of the Hollywood movie \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d, Residenzplatz is yet another highlight: During their carriage ride through the city, Maria and the children sing as they pass the Residenz Fountain.\nResidence Fountain | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg / G.Breitegger \nResidence Fountain | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg / G.Breitegger \nResidenzbrunnen, Neue Residenz und Dom | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg / B.

The Ferdinand Porsche Erlebniswelten fahr(T)raum in Mattsee, only 15 km from Salzburg, exhibits technology close-up on 4,500 square metres. On a journey through time, you can observe automobiles and aircraft from past eras.\nMilestones of mobility\nFerdinand Porsche is considered the forefather of Porsche and VW and already built electric and hybrid engines into his first cars. He made history with the Austro Daimler Prinz Heinrich, which is considered the world's first real sports car, as well as the Kaiserwagen from 1912. What is less well known, is that Ferdinand Porsche was involved in the motorisation of agricultural equipment as early as 1915. A large collection of historic tractors is on display in the Traktor-Stadl.\nVintage cars and aircrafts close-up\nThe presentation is designed in such a way that visitors can get up close and personal with the valuable automobiles and historic aircrafts. Everything worth knowing can be accessed via multimedia touch screens.\nWith the flug(T)raum, the existing exhibition was expanded by some 800 m\u00b2. In addition to the expansion of the Austro Daimler exhibition and a gallery on the success story of the VW Beetle, the historic Hansa-Brandenburg C1 and Klemm L20 aircraft are the highlights of the new exhibition. \nFun with technology and mobility\nState-of-the-art simulators offer a realistic driving experience and turn centrifugal forces into an adventure. The hands-on experience with the Carrera race tracks give enthusiasts of all ages the chance to delve into the world of their racing idols. In addition to the exciting exhibition and many activity stations, the knowledge rally takes visitors through the fahr(T)raum, where the whole family can learn about the automotive pioneer Ferdinand Porsche and his innovative technology in a playful way.\n20% reduction with SalzburgCard (only available when purchasing tickets at the ticket counter).

Cheers! \nDIY Radler [shandy] Would you rather have a shandy? The we'd recommend: take a 1l mug, order a small beer and a limo [lemonade] at the cash-desk \u2013 then the mug will be half-filled with beer, and you choose the fizzy drink to fill up the shandy.

Actually, until 1685 it actually consisted of two buildings. It was first referred to as the \"Dance Master's House\" in 1713: since 1711, a certain Lorenz Sp\u00f6ckner had been offering dancing lessons there for the nobility, in preparation for their life at court.\nThe Mozarts move in\nFriends of the Sp\u00f6ckner family, the Mozarts moved into their apartment in 1773, shortly after their third journey to Vienna. The house on the Getreidegasse where Mozart was born had simply become too small for the family or to host social gatherings appropriately. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart lived at the house on Makartplatz until he moved to Vienna in 1781. His mother died in 1778 and sister Nannerl got married in 1784, moving to St. Gilgen. The father first lived alone in the apartment \u2013 and from 1785 with his grandson Leopold Alois Pantaleon, who had been entrusted to his care.\nDestruction in the second world war and reconstruction\nAfter Leopold Mozart's death on 28 May 1787, the house saw several owners. On 16 October 1944, two thirds of the building was destroyed in an air raid. The part that had survived was bought by the International Mozart Foundation in 1955. An office building was constructed on the site of the ruins, which the Foundation also bought up in 1989. After it had been demolished, the Mozart Residence was reconstructed true to the original building plans.\nThe museum at the Mozart Residence\nOn 26 January 1996, the Mozart Residence celebrated its reopening. In the museum, you can see \u2013 in addition to Mozart's pianoforte \u2013 many original documents and portraits. The exhibition provides an array of interesting facts about the history of the house, Mozart\u2019s Salzburg years and the life of the Mozart family. A multi-vision show as well as rotating exhibitions, concerts and talks offer a very rich and diverse Mozart experience.\nYou should allow yourself about one-and-a-half hours to discover the Mozart Residence. With the Salzburg Card, you will be admitted for free. \nThe Magic Flute House \nThe story behind this shed harks back to the year 1791, when Mozart is said to have composed his famous work The Magic Flute in it. At that time it was standing in the garden behind the Freihaustheater in Vienna, where the opera was first performed in September of 1791. In 1873, through the initiative of the Mozarteum Foundation, the little house was moved to Salzburg. \nAfter an extensive renovation process in the summer of 2022, the small wooden house stands in the courtyard of Mozart's Residence and incorporated into the museum as a fixed attraction. In the course of the renovations, the house was repainted in the same green as in Mozart's times.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2783, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25ddd7b9-ae2f-4286-a86d-e20aa1a182c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "25ddd7b9-ae2f-4286-a86d-e20aa1a182c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/city-of-mozart/mozarteum-foundation"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a387533a-e036-4c1e-a10a-3a0ea00a8cc2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/city-of-mozart/mozarteum-foundation"}, "hash": "f0e85491c3c5f764fcdc2780eccd97a12c4be9b432e4a8d86cce9a260dfaf016", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Musical history meets the present-day\nUniting the Mozart legacy with contemporary culture \u2013 the Mozarteum Foundation has dedicated itself to this mission since it was founded by citizens of Salzburg City in 1842.

The state-rooms reflect two centuries of art and design history, from the Renaissance through the Baroque, to Classicism. In addition, they are an authentic experiential place in Salzburg's musical history: The first opera north of the Alps was performed in the Carabinierisaal. Wolfgang Amad\u00e9 Mozart gave his first Salzburg court concert in the Konferenzzimmer at the age of seven. As court musician to the prince-archbishop, he composed for these rooms and performed in them himself - they were, along with the cathedral, his immediate sphere of professional activity. \nResidenzgalerie\nThe Residenzgalerie, founded in 1923, holds alternating exhibitions of 16th-19-century masterworks of Dutch, Italian, French and Austrian painting. \nCathedral archway terrace \nThe Cathedral archway terrace, which links the Residenz with the Cathedral, offers an incomparable view of the baroque heart of Salzburg. The transformation of Salzburg into a prestigious baroque city with Italian flair began around 1600 under Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau and was continued and completed by his successors. A digitally animated video depicting Salzburg's architectural history is on display in the cathedral archway.\nNorth Oratory\nIn four adjoining rooms in the North Oratory of the Cathedral, alternating exhibitions are held. The stucco-work dates from 1628, the year the baroque Cathedral was consecrated. Of particular interest is St Rupert's Oratory, where the altar and ceiling paintings show scenes from the life of St Rupert. \nCathedral organ loft\nThe DomQuartier tour leads through the main organ loft, offering splendid a view of the entire interior of the Cathedral \u2013 one of the most magnificent monumental buildings of the Early Baroque. \nCathedral Museum\nThe Cathedral Museum in the South Oratory, opened in 1974, shows art treasures from 1,300 years of ecclesiastical history. Its chief exhibit is the Cathedral treasure. Precious liturgical objects such as chalices, monstrances and chasubles are on display, as well as Gothic and Baroque paintings and sculptures from Salzburg's churches and monasteries. The most outstanding exhibit is the Cross of St Rupert, the largest surviving early mediaeval metal cross. It is considered one of the oldest known Christian works of art in Austria. \nCabinet of Curiosities\nThe Cabinet of Curiosities, installed by Prince Archbishop Guidobald Graf Thun, was designed to impress not only state visitors with exotic or bizarre objects from the spheres of art, nature and technology, thus demonstrating the territory's wealth. The marble floor, ceiling stucco and showcases are all original. In 1974, purchases and loans enabled the reconstruction of the Cabinet of Curiosities in the style of a baroque Wunderkammer. \nLange Galerie\nThe 70m-long Lange Galerie, decorated with elaborate ceiling stucco, is considered one of the earliest gallery buildings north of the Alps. Until secularisation in 1803, it served to exhibit the archiepiscopal painting collection. Hanging here today are large-scale paintings from the art collection of St Peter's Archabbey. \nSt. Peter's Museum \nSt. Peter's Museum, in the Wallis wing of the building, presents selected art treasures from the collection of St Peter's Archabbey, the oldest monastery in the German-speaking world.

Except for a few years\u2019 hiatus, \u201cJedermann\u201d has been performed annually at the Salzburg Festival ever since \u2013 the undisputed highlight of Festival season.\nThe Plot of \u201cJedermann\u201d\nHofmannsthal\u2019s morality play tells a virtually universal story: God sends Death in order to summon the rich bon vivant Jedermann. In his hour of greatest need, he is abandoned by his friends, his money and his lover. Only after he has repented for his transgressions and committed himself to Christianity, may he stand armed with his faith and his good deeds before the divine judgment seat.\nSalzburg Cathedral Square as Open-Air Stage\nTraditionally, \u201cJedermann\u201d is performed outdoors, on Cathedral Square in front of the cathedral entrance. A place seemingly predestined as the stage and backdrop for this religious play. When the cathedral fa\u00e7ade is cast in the evening light, the monumental statues of the saints automatically become a powerful part of the set itself. An iconic atmosphere indeed, with which the Grosses Festspielhaus \u2013 which serves as a stand-in should the weather not cooperate, and despite its better acoustics \u2013 simply can\u2019t quite compare.\nFamous \u201cJedermann\u201d Stars\nThe cast of \u201cJedermann\u201d has always read like a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of the German-speaking theater world.

His parents, Leopold Mozart and Anna Maria Pertl, laid the foundation for his musical career. His early death at the age of just 35 shook everyone, but especially his sister \u201cNannerl\u201d.\nA wunderkind known as \u201cWolferl\u201d\nOn 27 January 1756, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is born in the \u201cHagenauer Haus\u201d (No. 9 Getreidegasse) in Salzburg. Of their seven children in total, Leopold Mozart, musician to the court of the prince archbishop, and wife Anna Maria Walpurga have only one other who survives: Mozart\u2019s elder sister Maria Anna, nicknamed \u201cNannerl\u201d. Both of them are exceptionally gifted, one reason why the father puts his own career somewhat on the back burner.\nThe travels of young Mozart\nBeginning in 1762, the ambitious father presents his talented children before princely courts across Europe. At the tender age of just six, little Mozart embarks on a long journey through Western Europe \u2013 from Germany, Belgium and France, all the way to London. He would continue to develop his musical skills in Italy.\nThe Salzburg Years\nMozart spends his youth as an honorary, and from 1772 as a salaried concert-master at the Salzburg court in the service of two Salzburg prince archbishops: Sigismund Graf Schrattenbach (reigned 1753-1771) and Hieronymus Graf Colloredo (reigned 1772-1803). The court musician works in the state rooms of the Residenz and the Cathedral. His fruitless search for a different appointment leads him to Italy, Vienna and Munich. In autumn 1773, the family moves into the house on Hannibalplatz, now known as the \u201cMozart Residence\u201d whose address today is No. 8 Makartplatz.\nBreak with the Salzburg Archbishop\nWith Salzburg gaining a new ruler in 1772, Mozart is once again able to lead a more ordered life. Under Archbishop Hieronymus Graf Colloredo, in 1779 he reenters court service as an organist. However, after the premier of \u201cIdomeneo\u201d in Munich at the beginning of June 1781, Mozart falls out with the archbishop.\nMove to Vienna and starting a family\nIn Vienna, he tries to make his way as a freelance performer, opera composer and teacher. On 4 August 1782, against the will of his father, he marries Constanze Weber. Together, the couple travel to Salzburg and Prague. Of their six children, only Karl Thomas and Franz Xaver Wolfgang survive beyond childhood.\nMozart\u2019s Early Death\nOne of his last operatic successes is \u201cLa Clemenza di Tito\u201d (K 621), the \u201cCoronation Opera\u201d first performed in Prague on 6 September 1791. Shortly after the premier pf \u201cThe Magic Flute\u201d (K 620) at the Freihaustheater in Vienna, Mozart falls ill. He dies in Vienna on 5 December 1791 at the age of 35 from a \u201cextreme miliary fever\u201d. His \u201cRequiem\u201d (K 626) remains uncompleted.\nMozart statue on the Mozart square in Salzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nMozart statue on the Mozart square in Salzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nMozart Ball | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nMozart Ball | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nMozartplatz in Salzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nMozartplatz in Salzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3086, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0abf29a-76df-4c91-9b93-7afbcd8be9e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0abf29a-76df-4c91-9b93-7afbcd8be9e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/salzburg-festival/ceremony-festival-opening"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "692593f5-6f89-4d21-9515-f6be81f92cb7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/salzburg-festival/ceremony-festival-opening"}, "hash": "d5223b83c98ee329fa80534d8026d4363976bc2031f243eb455d65ed75c51b5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "July 2025\nOpening celebrations mark the traditional start of the summer festival season in Salzburg.

The story of the Salzburg Festival is closely tied to names like Max Reinhardt, Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Herbert von Karajan.\nThe History of the Salzburg Festival\nThe idea of creating a festival in Salzburg as an extension of a centuries-old theatrical tradition first surfaced towards the end of World War One. It was driven by well-known personalities of that time, and especially director Max Reinhardt, writer Hugo von Hofmannsthal and composer Richard Strauss. The Salzburg Festival itself was born on 22 August 1920, with a performance of \u201cJedermann\u201d on Cathedral Square. Concerts and operas would soon be added to the program.\nOne of the World\u2019s Greatest Music Festivals\nThough one of the most prestigious music festivals in the world today, the Festival has also gone through difficult times. During the Second World War, the future of the Festival seemed very bleak indeed. The fact that, in the post-war years, things rapidly returned to normal, allowing the Festival to continue its development into the multi-week event of today \u2013 is very much due to the tireless dedication of the Festival directors.\nThe Makers of the Salzburg Festival\nOne of these distinguished himself above all: Herbert von Karajan. From the beginning of his involvement with the Festival until his death in 1989, he shaped the Salzburg Festival like no other: from internationalization of the event to construction of the Grosses Festspielhaus, and the founding of the Easter Festival. His successors, including names such as Gerard Mortier, Peter Ruzicka and Alexander Pereira, had some big, and not always easy shoes to fill.\nTraditional meets Modern\nAs we see, the Salzburg Festival proudly looks back on a long history \u2013 though has long since had its feet planted firmly in the present. Despite a huge respect for tradition, the repertoire is continuously being expanded: from a musical focus on Mozart and Strauss to brand-new contemporary works. Allowing the Festival to speak to a broad spectrum of different audiences, with something certain to appeal to practically everyone.\nHave we sparked your curiosity?

Back then, the so-called \u201cTandlmarkt\u201d would be held on Cathedral Square in the heart of the city, offering a wide range of goods for the locals to buy. By the 17th century, this Advent market had been christened the \u201cNikolaimarkt\u201d \u2013 that is to say, the \u201cSaint Nicholas\u2019 Market\u201d. For two weeks before and two weeks after St. Nicholas\u2019 Day (on 6 December), a variety of products were offered for sale on and close to Cathedral Square: from a delectable selection of foods, to dolls and all kinds of bric-a-brac. The \"Nikolaimarkt\" was one of the most famous Advent markets of its day, second only to the ones in Vienna, Paris, Amsterdam and Nuremberg. From 1903 until the early 1930s, the Christmas market was restricted to the area adjacent to the cathedral arches.\n50th anniversary: Christmas Market with Unique Atmosphere\nThe Salzburg Christkindlmarkt, as it is known today around the world, has existed since 1974. Every year, the market is officially opened with befitting pomp and circumstance on the Thursday preceding the first Sunday in Advent, closing its shutters for the final time on 1 January. Local folk customs and traditional decorations for the Christmas tree, gifts for big and small, incense to help conjure up a festive atmosphere in your own home, all kinds of delectable treats in the form of Austrian specialties, mulled wine and hot punch: At the Christmas market on Salzburg\u2019s Cathedral Square, you will discover practically everything you could possibly wish for. This famous Advent market draws countless visitors every Christmas season, and is also very popular with the locals, too. Not least because of the traditional huts and unique atmosphere, along with specially designed lighting that stretches above the market stands like romantic stars across the night sky.\nEvents at the Salzburg Christkindlmarkt\nThe Christkindlmarkt isn\u2019t only a location for around 100 market stands. The organizers have also ensured that visitors are treated to a colorful daily events program: readings of Christmas stories for children, Krampus parades, guided Christmas tours, choral concerts, visits by the \u201cChrist Child\u201d, festive melodies performed from the surrounding towers, and so much more.\n\u201cSing-Along\u201d in a choir open to singers from the general public \u2013 every Tuesday from 6 \u2013 8 p.m.\nTraditional wind music \u2013 performed high above the square every Wednesday at 6 p.m. and every Thursday and Saturday at 6:30 p.m.\nVisit of the Salzburg \u201cChrist Child\u201d with his angels \u2013 every Sunday, 4 p.m.\nChildren\u2019s reading with the \u201cChrist Child\u201d \u2013 every Wednesday at 4 p.m.\nThe traditional Christkindlmarkt becomes the stage for the turn of the year as a New Year's Eve market \nAn exciting supporting programme will shorten the waiting time for the turn of the year (details to follow).

The event grew in popularity from year to year, and in 1950 it moved to the Kaisersaal of the Salzburg Residenz, in 1952 to the Great Hall of Salzburg University, and in 1960 to the newly built Large Festival Hall, where it still takes place today. Initially, the focus was on singing and music, but later readings and theatre performances were added to the programme.\nSalzburg's second largest Advent singing event, the Salzburger Advent\u00ae in St. Andr\u00e4 Church on Mirabellplatz, was founded in 1991. The Salzburger HirtenAdvent in the Great Hall of the University was founded in 2006.\nThe Salzburg Advent Singing as a genre of its own\nWhat began as a Christmas carol concert carol in 1946 has evolved over the decades to become a genre in its own right, serving as a model for many Advent Singings in German-speaking countries.

Sporting hand-carved wooden masks, shaggy pelts and heavy bells, these wild figures are said to scare away the dark spirits of winter. A living example of centuries-old folk customs.\nWild and Eerie Characters: Krampus- and Perchten Parades in Salzburg\nThe wild jangling of bells, shaggy pelts, curved horns and terrifying masks: When Krampus and Perchten run down the street, growling, half dancing, half stamping, every single spectator is left just a little unsettled. Krampus- and Perchten parades truly are an unforgettable experience, as much a part of Salzburg\u2019s Christmas season as the famous Christkindlmarkt and the almost meditative Advent Singing. From the end of November until the beginning of December, you can also experience this unique folk custom in the City of Salzburg itself. While no one would claim Perchten parades are peaceful, they will definitely leave you with lasting memories. An ancient tradition you can only experience in this part of the Alpine world.\nFiendish Figure: Krampus\nKrampus- and Perchten parades look back on a long tradition in Austria. That said, Krampus and Percht are far from being identical figures. In Alpine tradition, Krampus is a devil-like creature who accompanies Saint Nicholas on 6 December. In contrast to St. Nick\u2019s gift bearers, Krampus comes along with chains and a switch, looking for those children who weren\u2019t as good as they ought to have been in the past year. It is said that \u201cKrampus\u201d got his name from yet another attention-getting feature, his long claws. \u201cGrampa\u201d is the Italian word for \u201cclaw\u201d. The Krampus tradition existed throughout the Habsburg empire and in neighboring regions.\nPercht, Sch\u00f6nperchten and Schiachperchten\nPerchten, for their part, are folk figures we only encounter in the Alpine regions of Bavaria and Austria. According to various sources, their name probably derives from the legendary character \u201cPerchta\u201d (also: \u201cBerchta\u201d). If you pay close attention, you will notice there are actually two different types of Perchten: the \u201cgood\u201d Sch\u00f6nperchten and the \u201cevil\u201d Schiachperchten, whose masks are especially scary. Their artistically carved masks, incidentally, have all been made by hand. Members of both groups of Perchten each carry one or more bells, intended to help drive away the winter.\nAccording to tradition, Perchten only appear during Twelvetide between winter solstice on 21 December and Epiphany on 6 January. Nowadays, however, Perchten runs take place throughout December. Perchten marchers from Gastein are known to have paraded during a visit of Emperor Ferdinand I back in 1837. No surprise, then, that Gastein Perchten have been proud members of the UNESCO World Intangible Heritage List since 2011.\nThe folklore \u201cboom\u201d of the 20th century also resulted in the distinction between Krampus and Percht become more and more blurred. We even see the development of so-called \u201cKrampusperchten\u201d, along with the birth of numerous local groups, known as \u201cP\u00e4sse\u201d, celebrating the tradition. There are around 200 such P\u00e4sse in Salzburg alone.\nLiving Tradition\nIt is said that, at every Perchten parade, there is actually one real Percht in the masses. And when you observe these wild characters from a safe distance, as the many lights reflect off their creative masks, you sometimes do have to take a second look: Did I just see an ear twitching there? Or was it just the wind? Isn\u2019t there always some kernel of truth to every legend? Now, Percht, Krampus, the Krampusperchten and the witches have already passed us by. But we will be lining the streets again next year, as the P\u00e4sse parade by, provoking occasional shrieks from spectators. And perhaps then we will be able to pinpoint precisely which one of the Perchten is \u201cthe real thing\u201d.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3868, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb98ad16-e1ab-4cfc-ba2f-1f8bf9d11914": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb98ad16-e1ab-4cfc-ba2f-1f8bf9d11914", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/advent/krampus-percht"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66ac9d28-0414-4db5-ae6d-74d5eb98c061", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/advent/krampus-percht"}, "hash": "9e9d26bedb737731429947e378389fa335736e32b3a062c874b81fcaf5e495c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b144097b-f9ce-465a-b443-313eb44603d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/advent/krampus-percht"}, "hash": "470c5f391e85e2400316dc5e0082ac163c22c37f45d54b8250ec101f46c9246c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There are around 200 such P\u00e4sse in Salzburg alone.\nLiving Tradition\nIt is said that, at every Perchten parade, there is actually one real Percht in the masses.

At our Silent Night communities here in Salzburger Land, the story behind the world\u2019s most beloved Christmas song is brought vividly to life. Roam in the footsteps of its creators, Franz Xaver Gruber and Joseph Mohr!\nProbably the world\u2019s most popular Christmas carol\nDefinitely a hit song: \u201cSilent Night\u201d has been translated into more than 300 languages and dialects \u2013 making it one of the world\u2019s most popular songs ever. It was first performed on December 24, 1818 at St. Nicholas\u2019 Church in Oberndorf near Salzburg. The text was penned by Salzburg clergyman Joseph Mohr, while the melody was composed by Upper Austrian teacher Franz Xaver Gruber. A special distinction: since 2011, \u201cSilent Night\u201d has been listed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List.\nSilent Night Landmarks in Salzburg City\n\u201cSilent Night\u201d fans find additional clues to the history of the song in Salzburg itself, the city where Joseph Mohr was born. Joseph Mohr grew up at No. 31 Steingasse, and he was actually christened over the same font as Mozart, in Salzburg Cathedral. He attended the Lyceum (today, Salzburg University and the Great Hall). The young student earned a little additional income by performing at St. Peter\u2019s Benedictine Abbey. Later, he entered the religious seminary located on Makartplatz Square. Salzburg Museum displays a manuscript by Mohr, upon which he confirmed that he had, indeed, written \u201cSilent Night\u201d in 1816.\nOn the traces of Joseph Mohr\nA musical journey through Salzburg\nNumerous towns and villages in Salzburg have ties to the story of \u201cSilent Night\u201d:\nOberndorf: The Silent Night Memorial Chapel stands at the site where the song was performed for the very first time. The Silent Night Museum recounts the history behind the song. Christmas wishes can be sent to your personal bringer-of-gifts at the Silent Night Post Office.\nArnsdorf near Oberndorf: It was here that Franz Xaver Gruber composed the melody to \u201cSilent Night\u201d at the schoolhouse. He was also sacristan at the pilgrimage church there. Today, the schoolhouse is home to a museum.\nMariapfarr: As a curate here, Mohr wrote the poem \u201cSilent Night\u201d in 1816. Be sure to visit the Silent Night Museum with its nativity scene (1750) and reconstructed \u201cMohr Room\u201d as well as the parish church!\nWagrain: Mohr spent the last eleven years of his life in Wagrain. The Joseph Mohr Memorial Organ in the parish church, the Joseph Mohr Room at the Waggerl House as well as his grave, all remind us of this cherished parish priest.\nHallein: This \u201cCity of Salt\u201d was yet another important place in the life and work of Gruber, and also where he died. His former home in the Silent Night District houses a museum, while his grave lies right outside.\nWhat are the song\u2019s shared roots with Upper Austria and Tyrol?\nThe \u201cSilent Night\u201d towns of Hochburg-Ach and Ried im Innkreis have close ties to teacher and composer Franz Xaver Gruber. In Steyr, the earliest-known version of the song in print was published.\nIt was from the \u201cSilent Night\u201d towns of F\u00fcgen and Hippach in Zillertal that the \u201cNationals\u00e4nger\u201d singers came, who made the song internationally famous. One of them, Ludwig Rainer, grew up in Zillertal, and, after his musical tours which took him around the world, made his home in the Achensee region.\nSpecial anniversary celebrations during 2018\nIn 2018, Salzburger Land, Tyrol and Upper Austria celebrated the 200-year anniversary of this famous Christmas song together. A special exhibition at the Salzburg Museum, a musical play at the Felsenreitschule as well as Salzburg\u2019s traditional Advent Singing all dedicated themselves to the same theme.

She found him twenty-year-old governess Maria Augusta Kutschera, who was contemplating joining the Benedictine order. Just two years later, on 26 November 1927, the father of the family married his maid, who was almost 25 years his junior. They would have three children together.\nThe world-famous choir is established\nIn 1935, von Trapp lost his entire fortune due to bad speculation by his bank. This meant that the family had to rely on renting out parts of the house and performing concerts. Together with the children and house chaplain Franz Wasner, the proactive Maria established the Trapp Chamber Choir. Encouraged by soprano Lotte Lehmann, the young choir entered the folk singing competition at the Salzburg Festival in 1937 and promptly won first prize.\nThe family emigrates to the United States\nIn 1938, after Austria's Anschluss to Hitler's Germany, Georg von Trapp received a draft order to join the German navy. His dislike of the National Socialists and his refusal to accept an invitation to Hitler's birthday party prompted the family to travel to St. Georgen near Bruneck in South Tyrol and then via London to the USA. The Trapps then settled in Stowe, Vermont. From there The Trapp Family Singers would spend 20 productive years touring the American continent, Australia, the Fiji Islands and Hawaii.\nThe legend of the Trapp family lives on in the famous cult film The Sound of Music (1965), which was mainly filmed in Salzburg.

In addition to the monastery, you will find Imbergkirche church as well as the Hettwerbastei (an excellent lookout point), with its unique view of Hohensalzburg Fortress and the historic district on the opposite side of the river. \nThe Kapuzinerberg and its fortifications\nThe 400-year-old defensive walls along the flanks of the Kapuzinerberg, beginning at the Felixpforte, enclose the Capuchin monastery and run the entire western, southern and eastern flanks of this rocky outcropping. Standing at the northern end of this bastion is the \"Franziski-Schl\u00f6ssl\", built under Prince-Archbishop Paris Lodron in 1629. Originally constructed purely for defensive purposes, it was turned into a tavern back in 1849, since when it has served as a popular excursion destination and refreshment stop. The path up to the Franziski-Schl\u00f6ssl leads along enchanting hiking paths, through the forest and even on the fortifications themselves.\nIn addition to the Franziski-Schl\u00f6ssl, the \"Paschinger-Schl\u00f6\u00dfl\" at No.5 Kapuzinerberg is also well known. From 1919 to 1934, famous author Stefan Zweig lived here. A bust above the villa commemorates the famous writer. A second bust, a few meters farther up the mountain, depicts this city\u2019s most famous genius: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\nCity hikes, climbing and chamois\nFor rock climbers, the steep north face of the Kapuzinerberg provides an excellent opportunity: Use of the so-called \"City Wall\u201d fixed-cable climb is permitted from July until March. Climbing activities are not permitted during the remaining months since this is also a protected habitat for birds during nesting season.

To do so, they brought the greatest architects of the day to Salzburg. Good reason, then, why baroque Salzburg is often referred to as the \u201cRome of the North\u201d.

Since 1901, wheat beers have been brewed in innovative ways and to the highest quality standards here in Schallmoos.\nSalzburg\u2019s most famous Weissbier\nAdelbert Behr is generally regarded as the founding father of Salzburg\u2019s Weissbier tradition. Back in 1900, at his small brewery in Schallmoos, he began brewing the first light wheat beer, the starting point for what would become a fabulous success story. To this day, the beer produced by \u201cDie Weisse\u201d is brewed in strict adherence to the original recipe, standing proudly and impressively alongside the other representatives of Salzburg\u2019s beer culture. \nTradition meets Innovation\nAside from focusing on traditional brewing artistry, \u201cDie Weisse\u201d also values progress and ongoing development. With their introduction of the first gluten-free organic wheat beer in 2015, the team which surrounds Felix Gmachl filled a gap on the international market. The bottle featuring a swing stopper guarantees a secondary fermentation process which makes their Weissbier quite unique, responsible for the characteristic fruity aroma as well as the fine-beaded head. \nIf you want to enjoy one of their brews in an authentic setting, there is nowhere better than the brewery\u2019s own traditional inn or in the shaded beer garden. \nDie Weisse in Salzburg | \u00a9 Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nDie Weisse in Salzburg | \u00a9 Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nWei\u00dfbier von der Weissen | \u00a9 Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nWei\u00dfbier von der Weissen | \u00a9 Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nSudwerk in der Weissen | \u00a9 Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nSudwerk in der Weissen | \u00a9 Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nFelix Gmachl, Die Weisse | \u00a9 Valentin Weinh\u00e4upl Photography \nFelix Gmachl, Die Weisse | \u00a9 Valentin Weinh\u00e4upl Photography \nDie Weisse | \u00a9 Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nDie Weisse | \u00a9 Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nDie Weisse - Salzburger Wei\u00dfbierbrauerei\nRupertgasse 10\nTel. +43662 872246", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2140, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26919d39-18a3-48a7-95af-ae951988ef7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "26919d39-18a3-48a7-95af-ae951988ef7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/beer-culture/guided-beer-tours"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8de93cb1-5b72-4bd1-a609-8dbb87f0bd11", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/beer-culture/guided-beer-tours"}, "hash": "d7bdae3f3b64df09c8956812182997e1382c6dd294e759a920fc8badb70abf67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Bierf\u00fchrungen\nGuided beer tours & beer hikes\nIn the mood to experience the beer culture of Salzburg?

Unique features include its tall Gothic tower with characteristic helm and double-lantern spire. \nHistory \nM\u00fclln Parish Church stands on historic ground: Even back in pre-Christian times, this hilltop above the banks of the River Salzach in the M\u00fclln section of Salzburg was a site of pagan worship. A chapel consecrated to the Virgin Mary is believed to have stood here as early as 1048. Over the years, the chapel became too small, which is why construction of a Late Gothic hall church began in 1439. A consecration ceremony was held here in 1453. \nArchitecture and Interior\nM\u00fclln Church underwent its final exterior remodeling during the Late Baroque: The modest entrance gives practically no hint of the magnificence that awaits visitors within. Two lions\u2019 heads adorn the church portal, while the hall is dominated by a mighty high altar made of red marble. It contains a precious, and purportedly miraculous statue of the Madonna with Child, a Late Medieval masterpiece from 1460. Other eye-catching features include a splendidly adorned pulpit as well as a two-story music gallery, whose balustrades extend the entire length of the room. \nM\u00fclln Church today\nThe idyllic cemetery dating back to the year 1453 \u2013 known as \"Heaven\u2019s Terrace\" - is also worth a visit, having reopened to visitors in May 2017 after almost 140 years.

For 500 years, the monks who had lived in the monastery were laid to rest in the columbaria here.

Due to this work, the Salzburg Museum in the New Residenz will likely remain closed until autumn 2026.\nAward-winning Salzburg Museum in the New Residenz is a museum with character. In an area totalling 3,000 m2, permanent exhibitions and alternating special exhibitions show the art and cultural history of the Town and the Province of Salzburg.\nUnique Salzburg\nOn the first floor of the New Residenz, Salzburg Museum demonstrates Salzburg's distinctive quality with objects from all fields of the collection. From ancient times up to the present: modern, interestingly designed rooms take the visitor through the ages, explaining how Salzburg developed into its present unique form. \nSalzburg \u2013 the myth\nOn the second floor of the New Residenz, the \"myth\" of Salzburg is investigated. In pictures and texts, Romantic-age painters, writers and scholars spread their enthusiasm for the Salzburg region throughout Europe. Visitors learn how Salzburg rose to become a baroque town, how the urban structures developed after the archbishopric was secularised in 1803, and how tourism gained momentum, resulting in the \"myth\" of the town. \nArt gallery\nThe art gallery in Salzburg Museum is under the inner courtyard of the New Residenz. It is a two-part, multi-functional hall with a luminous ceiling extending throughout. Every year, three major special exhibitions are presented in these exceptional premises. \nFurther locations of Salzburg Museum\nPanorama Museum \nSalzburg Carillon \nToy Museum \nFortress Museum\nFolklore Museum\nCathedral Excavation Museum\nDomQuartier | North Oratory \nCeltic Museum, Hallein\nSilent Night Museum, Hallein \nLearn more about the Salzburg Museum in the Salzburg Magazine\nHistories & Stories in the Salzburg Museum\nAdmission fees: incl. audio guide \nAdults \u20ac 9.00 \nChildren (6-15 years) \u20ac 3.00 \nYouths (16-26 years) \u20ac 4.00 \nPeople with disabilities (disability pass required) free - accompanying person free (if indicated on disability pass)\nFamilies (2 adults and children) \u20ac 18.00 \nGroups (adults), senior citizens, per person \u20ac 7.00 \nGuided tour, per person \u20ac 2.50 \nGuided tour (max. 25 persons) \u20ac 80.00 \nSchool classes (without guided tour) free \nSchool classes (with guided tour), per person \u20ac 1.50 \nSalzburgCard: one time free admission \nCombined ticket: Salzburg Museum | Neue Residenz and Panorama Museum\nAdults \u20ac 10.00 \nChildren (6-15 years) \u20ac 3.50 \nYouths (16-26 years) \u20ac 4.50 \nPeople with disabilities (disability pass required) free - accompanying person free (if indicated on disability pass)\nFamilies (2 adults and children) \u20ac 20.00 \nGroups (adults), senior citizens, per person \u20ac 8.50 \nSchool classes (no guided tour) free \nSalzburgCard: one time free admission \n(Status: 10/2022)\nThe Salzburg Museum provides barrier-free access.

The name of the regiment derives from Archduke Rainer Ferdinand, a nephew twice-removed of Emperor Franz Joseph I. \nThe museum today \nThe nucleus of this exhibition in eight rooms are artifacts from times of war and peace.

He celebrated his Salzburg debut as an actor in 1893. However, his services to the Salzburg theater world culminated in his efforts, along with Hugo von Hofmannsthal, to create the Salzburg Festival.\nMemorandum for a Festival Hall\nIn Reinhardt\u2019s vision, the Festival was a reaction to the destruction of the First World War. Furthermore, he felt that art ought to help Austria find a new identity after the demise of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1917, Reinhardt published his \u201cMemorandum for construction of a festival hall in Hellbrunn\u201d. Though this was never built, the first Festival did take place in 1920. On temporary stages and, of course, on Cathedral Square \u2013 in keeping with Reinhardt\u2019s desire for an open-air festival.\nReinhardt at the Salzburg Festival\nWith Reinhardt\u2019s production of Jedermann in 1920, the Salzburg Festival was officially born. Many other productions would follow. Reinhardt remained director of the Festival until 1937, before emigrating to the United States. He died in New York on 31.11.1943. He also gained fame for founding the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna as well as his contributions to the development of modern directing techniques. In the Festival District, the Max-Reinhardt-Platz is named after him.\n\u201cLord of the Castle\u201d in Leopoldskron\nYet another location in Salzburg reminds us of the great director: In 1918, he bought Schloss Leopoldskron and the Meierhof which belongs to it. Reinhardt turned the estate into a gathering spot for Europe\u2019s \u201cBohemians\u201d, while the castle also provided a venue for stage productions. In addition, he had a garden theater built, which sadly no longer exists. One highlight: the library which Reinhardt established.\nPortrait from Max Reinhardt | \u00a9 Wikipedia / Nicola Perscheid \nPortrait from Max Reinhardt | \u00a9 Wikipedia / Nicola Perscheid \nFurther information:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2073, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dcd7a683-b430-4993-8788-f2e8d73e0f5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "dcd7a683-b430-4993-8788-f2e8d73e0f5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/churches-cemeteries/loretokirche"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d09ae503-299d-44b0-b0f4-fe137e979238", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/churches-cemeteries/loretokirche"}, "hash": "a9813d760067ca3d9be7e2505ae369cebc10b44f7ff4cfe679462b69cb50a554", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Loretokirche\nChurch of St. Maria Loreto\nDespite its unobtrusive fa\u00e7ade, the Loretokirche \u2013 a church close to Mirabell Gardens serving the nuns of the Capuchin Order \u2013 has a small surprise in store. Its interior is famous for its holy paintings, and especially for the so-called Loretokindel dating from the 17th century. \nLasting Impressions: The Loretokindel \nLoreto Church welcomes many visitors at all times of day. This is due, on the one hand, due its central location close to Mirabell Gardens on Paris-Lodron-Stra\u00dfe. On the other, those in search of peace and reflection find themselves surrounded by a number of holy paintings, including that of Maria Loreto in the right side-chapel. The Loretokindel also sees a constant flow of visitors and is venerated for its purportedly miraculous powers. This small, only 11 cm-tall ivory carving of Jesus dates from the 17th century. It is clad in a jewel-encrusted cloak that was made by nuns from the convent. Pilgrims from near and far come in order to press the figure against their head.\nConstruction History\nLoreto Church in Salzburg has a long and storied history that extends all the way back to the turmoil of the Thirty Years War. The nuns of the Loreto Convent in Landshut were compelled to flee to Salzburg in 1632. By Archbishop Paris Lodron, they were granted permission to build a convent, the cornerstone of which was laid in September 1633. The convent houses 30 cells for the use of nuns. \nSurviving the Upheavals of War\nWhen the French occupied Salzburg in 1800, the convent was used as a barracks and munitions depot. Just six years later and the convent was threatened by dissolution. In order to avoid this, the nuns decided to begin feeding the poor, and they have operated a soup kitchen for the needy ever since. In an air raid during the Second World War, the church was hit by bombs and heavily damaged. However, Loreto Church was rebuilt and re-consecrated in 1946. \nChurch service:\nSundays and Holidays 6:30 am, 8 am\nWorkdays 6:30 am, 8 am\nNo visits during mass!\nVisits of the \"Loreto-Kindel\" (little ivory-made jesus):\nSundays and Holidays 8:45 am-9:30 am and 3 pm-3:30 pm\nWorkdays 8:30 am-10 am and 3 pm-4 pm\nSaturdays and the day before holidays: 8:30 am-10 am and 3 pm-3:30 pm\nFatima day (13th of every month) additionally: 5:30 pm-6:30 pm\nentrance - Paris-Lodron-Strasse | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg / S.

The mighty structure was erected between 1694 and 1702. The architect drew upon the creations of Roman architects as models for his own church, which was also connected to the seminary itself. Particularly noteworthy are the new baroque elements introduced by Fischer von Erlach, which may also be observed at his other churches in Salzburg. The Church of the Holy Trinity became especially famous for its dome fresco by Johann Michael Rottmayr, depicting the coronation of Mary and the Holy Trinity. \nLasting Impressions: The Anliegenbuch\nIn its interior, visitors will find the so-called Anliegenbuch or \u201cBook of Concerns\u201d, where they have the opportunity to write down their worries and wishes.

At that time, a tunnel for the Almkanal was cut through the M\u00f6nchsberg to supply the city with water. Directly at the exit of the canal from the mountain, the monastery built a grain mill and also the bakery that is still appreciated today as St Peter's Abbey Bakery. \nWood-fired bread and baked goods \nWith its historic vaults, the Abbey Bakery presents itself rich in history. The extremely popular wood-fired bread made from pure natural sourdough is still baked in the original wood-fired oven. The bread keeps well and paired equally well with butter and jam as it is with cheese and ham. Other classics of the traditional bakery are mini brioches and Vintschgerl [aromatic rye and wheat bread from South Tyrol]. \nProduct range: original St Peter's wood-fired bread, various baked goods \nWorth seeing: directly next to the entrance to the bakery, the mill wheel at the Almkanal was rebuilt according to old models. \nStories about Stiftsb\u00e4ckerei St. Peter in the Salzburg Magazine\nHandcraft & Tradition\nThe Daily Bread of Salzburgers\nSalzburg to take home: shopping for sustainable souvenirs\nMonday*, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday 7 am-5 pm\nSaturday 7 am-1 pm\nFresh bread from approx. 8:45 am (Monday, Tuesday) or 7:45 am (Thursday-Saturday)\nClosed: Wednesday, Sunday\n* January/February: also closed on Mondays\nSt. Peter Stiftsb\u00e4ckerei | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nSt. Peter Stiftsb\u00e4ckerei | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nM\u00fchle St. Peter Stiftsb\u00e4ckerei | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nM\u00fchle St. Peter Stiftsb\u00e4ckerei | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nStiftsb\u00e4ckerei St. Peter | \u00a9 A.R.T. / P.

Worshippers may only ascend this staircase on their knees, a practice that evokes a common expression of piety during the Baroque era. Just like its role model in Rome, crosses were installed on the 2nd, 11th and 28th steps, symbolizing the drops of blood shed by Jesus Christ. The cross on the 2nd step has unfortunately been lost, only the empty casing still remaining. This stairway actually represents a particular honor bestowed upon Salzburg, since it is not merely a replica. Rather, it is an off-shoot of the original that is equally as holy. The stairs are open every Saturday from 11 a.m. to noon.\nIn 1591, Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich purchased an infirmary along with a church, in order to found a theological seminary that would be run by the Theatine (Cajetan) Order. The church was not completed until 1696 under the reign of Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun, finally consecrated in the year 1700. When the Salzburg chapter of the Theatine Order was dissolved in 1809, the Cajetan Church also came precariously close to falling into decay. In 1923, the church and the monastery were transferred to the Order of the Brothers of Mercy, who made every effort to ensure that the church was maintained and rehabilitated. During the Second World War, the building served as a military hospital and was damaged in a bombing raid. However, it was subsequently restored. \nArchitecture and Interior\nConstruction of the Cajetan Church also heralded the arrival of the Italian Baroque in Salzburg. The broad, palatial fa\u00e7ade treats the church and monastery as a unified architectural complex. It also features a mighty oblique-oval dome which underscores the sacred character of the building. \nThanks to the stuccowork, the church interior has a festive, stately and pure appearance. The dome, which permits abundant natural lighting, dominates the space.

When Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietric von Raitenau brought the Capuchins to Salzburg in 1594, he decided to transform this tower into a monastery with a church, which would then serve as the future home of the order.\nThe Path to the Capuchin Monastery\nMany paths lead up the Kapuzinerberg. If you begin your climb from the Linzer Gasse, the path will lead you past six baroque chapels depicting Stations of the Cross, concluding with an impressive Crucifixion group. Yet another path to the monastery leads via the Imbergstiege, past St. John\u2019s Chapel. Coming from the north-east of Salzburg, you can reach the Capuchin Monastery by following the Doblerweg from F\u00fcrbergstra\u00dfe \u2013 also taking you past the Franziskischl\u00f6ssl.\nThe Capuchin Monastery\nDespite its own modest architecture, the Capuchin Monastery is visible from afar due to the bastion before it and a towering cross.

The famous pilgrimage church, the Mount Calvary and the verdant nature all around never fail to captivate visitors, hikers and pilgrims. \nHistory\nThe story of Maria Plain goes back to the times of the Thirty Years War. In 1652, the purportedly miraculous painting \"Mary with Baby Jesus\" by Rudolf von Grimming came to the Plainberg outside Salzburg, where it was kept in a wooden chapel. After barely a year, the original painting had to be returned. However, because of the constant influx of pilgrims, a copy of the picture was made and housed in a new chapel. In 1671, Archbishop Max Gandolf decided to construct a large pilgrimage church. Built according to the plans drawn up by Giovanni Antonio Dario, the church was consecrated on 12 August 1674. Two years later, they were also successful in bringing the original painting back to Salzburg.\nArchitecture and Interior\nThe three-story fa\u00e7ade with two towers was modeled after Salzburg Cathedral, even though it is very much in keeping with the character of a pilgrimage church you might encounter out in the country. The church of Maria Plain on the Plainberg is visible from far away. The church\u2019s interior is filled with a golden aura, underscored by tones of blue and white. Maria Plain\u2019s famous painting is the focal point of the high altar itself. \nMaria Plain and the Mountain Cavalry \nThe Mountain Calvary on the southern slope of the Plainberg was built in the 17th century. One of only two in all of Salzburg province, it consists of four chapels leading to a crucifixion group.\nMozart and Maria Plain \nDue to their sense of profound piety, the pilgrimage church of Maria Plain was very close to the Mozart family. This was also the reason why Mozart enthusiast Johann Evangelist Engl assumed that Mozart composed his work, the \u201cCoronation Mass\u201d, for a festival to crown the famous painting at Maria Plain in 1779. To this day, an annual performance of the work does honor both to the painting as well as Mozart\u2019s genius.\nMaria Plain today\nMaria Plain is an attractive destination for pilgrims, with their climb to the top of the Plainberg rewarded by magnificent panoramic views of Salzburg City and the surrounding mountains. Pilgrims and trekkers exploring the Austrian stages of the Way of Saint James as well as the Arnoweg likewise pass by Maria Plain. This pilgrimage destination also provides one of the most beautiful wedding settings in Salzburg. \nmore Information about Maria Plain...\npilgrimage church Maria Plain and Mount Calvary | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \npilgrimage church Maria Plain and Mount Calvary | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nview at the City of Salzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nview at the City of Salzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \npilgrimage chruch Maria Plain | \u00a9 Albin Niederstrasser \npilgrimage chruch Maria Plain | \u00a9 Albin Niederstrasser \nMaria Plain in the evening | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nMaria Plain in the evening | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg \nWallfahrtskirche Maria Plain\nPlainbergweg 38\n5101 Bergheim \nTel. +43662 450194-0 \nConsent for missing marketing cookies", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3237, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78e6a5d1-87c2-4dcc-9b6e-818151cb0f53": {"__data__": {"id_": "78e6a5d1-87c2-4dcc-9b6e-818151cb0f53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/churches-cemeteries/schlosskirche-mirabell"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f918bcc4-113f-4df1-afb6-41882aa6673d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/churches-cemeteries/schlosskirche-mirabell"}, "hash": "0da097381d515e33299b0bfa1a05d78b85dd1ea4223b18f3e0b56e8693e506a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Schlosskirche Mirabell\nSchlosskirche Mirabell - Mirabell Palace Church\nDirectly next to the main entrance to Mirabell Palace is the entrance to the Mirabell Palace Church. This Salzburg treasure is best enjoyed as part of \"Music at Mirabell\".\nWhat is so special about this church? \nBesides the grand marble staircase and the magnificent marble hall, the palace church is one of the highlights of Mirabell Palace. Decorated entirely in white and gold and with walls entirely covered in marble stucco, the palace chapel exudes noble elegance. The magnificent high altar (1722) reaches up to the dome and is made of grey and pink marble. \nHow old is the palace church? \nMirabell Palace was built by Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau in 1606, when there was also a chapel in the palace. In the course of major alterations in the 1720s, the basis for today's church was created. In the town fire of 1818, the chapel was partially destroyed and had to be rebuilt. \nThe Mirabell Palace Church is only open during church services and concerts.\nMass: Sunday 10:30 am\nThe church provides barrier-free access from the Mirabellplatz entrance (not from the Mirabell palace courtyard). \nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 01.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 02.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 03.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 04.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 05.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 06.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 07.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 08.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 09.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 10.12.2024\nEntrance | \u00a9 Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nEntrance | \u00a9 Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar room | \u00a9 Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar room | \u00a9 Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar - Detail | \u00a9 Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar - Detail | \u00a9 Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar | \u00a9 Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar | \u00a9 Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nSchlosskirche Mirabell\nSchloss Mirabell, Eingang 1, Mirabellplatz\nTel. +43664 5770872", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2075, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d17650d7-5b1a-4972-a987-e8b9f6fa06a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d17650d7-5b1a-4972-a987-e8b9f6fa06a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/churches-cemeteries/markuskirche"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b4613131-0050-4183-8d16-95dad70ce169", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/churches-cemeteries/markuskirche"}, "hash": "e6fe9ea9eb494362484aed89a30b68048ef8840e9c695e97e3be964d0ca5342c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Markuskirche\nMarkuskirche - St. Mark's Church\nThe 400-year-old St. Mark's church is located in Salzburg's Old Town near the Klausentor.

St. Erhard was a contemporary of Salzburg's patron, St. Rupert Rupert. Of Irish/Scottish heritage, St. Erhard was known as a miraculous healer of the sick and protector of the poor.\nArchitectural history\nIn 1689, the new Erhard Church was completed on the site of a small chapel, designed by the young architect Giovanni Gaspare Zugalli. In 1727 a cemetery was laid out opposite the church, but it was abandoned in the mid-19th century. In 1853 St Erhard's became a parish church and has remained so to this day. In its uniform Italian Baroque style, St Erhard's is one of the most remarkable sacred buildings in Salzburg.\nArchitecture and interior\nThe church is a masterpiece of Salzburg architecture originating in a period that was dominated by the Italian baroque style with all its extravagance, joy of life and wealth of colour and ornamentation. Its special features include the dome crowning the two square towers of the fa\u00e7ade, the double flight of steps and a wall fountain with a lion's head gargoyle. The water was said to come from a mineral spring with purifying and life-giving properties. \nThe interior of St. Erhard's Church is characterized by rich colours and elaborate decoration by the brothers Francesco and Carl-Antonio Brenno. The painting on the high altar depicts \"The Baptism of St. Ottilia by St. Erhard,\" painted in 1692 by Johann Michael Rottmayr. The spacious high altar, embellished with stucco marble, is the work of the sculptor Andreas G\u00f6tzinger.\nThe figures sculpted in the high relief represent Salzburg's three founding bishops, St. Rupert, St. Vitalis and St. Virgil, as well as St. Martin of Tours. The four cardinal virtues, prudence, fortitude, temperance and justice, are attributed to the four bishops.\nDaily 8 am-7 pm\nMass: Sunday 9 am\nThe St. Erhard's Church does not provide barrier-free access.

The cornerstone for the Christ Lutheran Church was laid on the banks of the Salzach in 1863. \nArchitectural history\nThe construction of the church was financed by generous donations from the Protestant world. 370 prisoners held captive in the Fortress during the Austro-Prussian War against Denmark helped build the church. It was consecrated in September 1867. The brick building on Elisabethkai was the first Protestant church in the Province of Salzburg.\nArchitecture and interior\nThe church is the product of the historicizing architecture representational of the stimuli and synthesis of former styles developing into an independent style of its own. It is the only example of romantic historicism found in Salzburg today. With its balanced proportions, a blend of the Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance styles, and the colorful change from the muted red building to the light grey ornamentation, the church gives a picturesque overall impression. The architect was especially proud of the high steeple and mighty balustrade, visible from afar. \nThe interior of the Christ Lutheran Church is austere, consistent with its sole purpose of preaching the word of the Gospel. The portrayal of Christ as a teacher and ruler is supplemented by symbols of the four Evangelists. Two paintings on both sides of the chancel portray events from the history of Protestantism in Salzburg: the oath of allegiance taken by Protestant farmers in Schwarzach and the Lutheran Expulsion in 1732. The beautiful stained glass window in the chancel was made by Albert Birkle in 1950. It expressively portrays Christ as a Good Shepherd with the lamb and the two Apostles, Peter and John. The lower part shows the Protestant emigrants in their traditional Salzburg costumes. \nThe Christ Lutheran Church today\nConcerts and other events are held at the church regularly.\nThe Christ Lutheran Church provides barrier-free access.

A few years after the war, they began rebuilding the church in a more simplified form. 1969/70 saw a major remodeling: The towers were shortened and capped off with flattish pyramid-shaped roofs, while the front of the church acquired a light-grey and white coloration.\nArchitecture and Interior\nThe interior of St. Andrew\u2019s Church in Salzburg reflects the modified pietistic style of today, characterized by few accent features.

Salzburg City served as a meeting place with his friends and acquaintances.\nRole in the founding of the Salzburg Festival\nThe idea of creating a festival for theater and music was sparked within Hofmannsthal\u2019s circle of friends. Which makes Hofmannsthal, along with director Max Reinhardt, writer Hermann Bahr and composer Richard Strauss, one of the founding fathers of the Salzburg Festival. In 1919, he published his vision in broad terms: The Festival in Salzburg would help overcome Austria\u2019s identity crisis after the end of the First World War and the dissolution of the Habsburg empire.\nThe Festival Classic \u201cJedermann\u201d\nIt was also Hofmannsthal\u2019s idea to perform a play in front of Salzburg Cathedral. Actually, this honor was bestowed upon \u201cJedermann\u201d quite by chance. Originally, a different mystery play had been intended for the purpose: However, Hofmannsthal\u2019s \"Das Salzburger Grosse Welttheater\" had not yet been completed by the time the first Festival opened in 1920. And so it was that \u201cJedermann\u201d \u2013 with just a few years interruption \u2013 became a permanent annual highlight of the Salzburg Festival.\nA key Festival force until the very end\nA performance of \u201cDas Salzburger Grosse Welttheater\u201d did eventually have a role to play, opening the new Festspielhaus in 1925. Hofmannsthal continued working to develop the Salzburg Festival until his death. He passed away on 15 July 1929 in Rodaun near Vienna. The City of Salzburg honored him by naming a street after him: Hugo-von-Hofmannsthal-Strasse in the Parsch section of town.\nLearn more about Hofmannsthal\u2019s most famous work \u201cJedermann\u201d!\nHugo von Hofmannsthal | \u00a9 Wikipedia \nHugo von Hofmannsthal | \u00a9 Wikipedia \nEveryman infront of the Salzburg Cathedral, 1920 | \u00a9 Salzburger Festspiele/Foto Ellinger \nEveryman infront of the Salzburg Cathedral, 1920 | \u00a9 Salzburger Festspiele/Foto Ellinger \nWikipedia", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2418, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a49698a9-fdef-417d-b6fa-3e9c70a9d384": {"__data__": {"id_": "a49698a9-fdef-417d-b6fa-3e9c70a9d384", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/dining-shopping/traditional-businesses/wieber-locksmiths-shop"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a330590a-1a48-4a1e-824f-519ea2ea095a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/dining-shopping/traditional-businesses/wieber-locksmiths-shop"}, "hash": "772a202c61c9ac150e8f5d4801bcda212dc9f4cddebb1776f935eb6fcbaa2441", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Wieber Locksmith's Shop\nWieber Locksmith's Shop\nSurrounded by flagship stores of international luxury brands, the Wieber locksmith's shop with its hidden courtyard in the middle of the old town has stood the test of time.

One special highlight is St. Sebastian\u2019s Cemetery \u2013 a veritable treasure in the very heart of Salzburg.\nHistory and Special Features\nThe history of St. Sebastian\u2019s Church goes back to Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach. He had the church built between 1505 and 1512. In the 18th century, the church \u2013 which had since become derelict \u2013 was demolished and replaced by a hall church reflecting the style of the Late Baroque. Special features of St. Sebastian\u2019s Church include the magnificent Rococo portal and an impressive gate separating the entrance porch from the main nave. The high altar is adorned by a wonderful Madonna with Child from the year 1611.\nModern Reconstruction \nThe devastating fire in 1818 \u2013 which also destroyed broad swaths of the right historical district \u2013 didn\u2019t spare St. Sebastian\u2019s Church either. The ceiling fresco and the painting at the high altar depicting St. Sebastian both fell victim to the flames. Restoration of the church began in the early 19th century: Charred baroque paintings were replaced by those of contemporary artists, while the confessionals also acquired a more modern form.\nSt. Sebastian\u2019s Cemetery and its Treasures \nPrince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau had the cemetery designed in the style of an Italian campo santo between 1595 and 1600. Members of Salzburg\u2019s most prominent families as well as famous personalities found their final resting place amid the cemetery\u2019s magnificent arcades. These include Mozart\u2019s father, Leopold, Wolfgang\u2019s wife, Constanze, as well as her second husband, Georg Nikolaus. Since 1564, the passageway leading to St. Sebastian\u2019s Cemetery has also been home to the tomb of famous physician Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, better known as \"Paracelsus\".\nThe most magnificent of all the sepulchers stands proudly in the middle of St. Sebastian\u2019s Cemetery, the Gabriel Chapel, mausoleum of Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich. It was built according to the plans of Elia Castello, and remains one of the architectural masterpieces associated with this famous ruler.\nDaily 9 am-4 pm (summer: until 6:30 pm)\nWinter: access to the cemetery only from the Bruderhof.\nNo visits during the mass!\nBarrier-free access to the cemetery from Linzer Gasse (to the right of the church) via ramps, otherwise several steps. \nSt. Sebastian's Church & Cemetery | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg / S.

The so-called \u201cHagenauer Haus\u201d at No. 9 Getreidegasse also belonged to the Hagenauer family, who in turn rented out the house to the Mozart family. It was here that, in 1756, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart came into the world. \nThe Griestor \nHagenauerplatz essentially interrupts the Getreidegasse on one side, whilst on the far end it leads out through the Griestor gate towards the River Salzach. This was originally the site of the \"Oberes Tr\u00e4nktor\" in the city wall, a gap providing access to ships on the river as well as an opportunity to water cattle. The former \"Wirtshaus zum L\u00f6chl\" at No. 2 Hagenauerplatz dates back to the 16th century and is known today by the name \u201cZum Eulenspiegel\u201d. Over the years, a number of tiny shops have also established themselves in the Griestor. \nArchitectural masterpieces \nThe house which stands on the corner of the Getreidegasse and Hagenauerplatz was first mentioned back in the year 1334 and is one of the true masterpieces of Salzburg\u2019s rich architectural history. One of the most opulent merchants\u2019 homes of the Late Middle Ages, it draws lots of attention, not least because of its oriel, which extends all the way up to the third story. From 1816 to 1917, this corner house was the location of Gasthaus and Hotel zur Goldenen Krone.\nNeptune Fountain and the Fish Market \nin the 16th and 17th centuries, the Salzburg Fish Market was held on Hagenauerplatz. Water which flowed from the Neptune Fountain located there was used to clean the fish. Due to the stench and the refuse created, the fish market was ultimately relocated to Ferdinand-Hanusch-Platz.

The ramp used by the horses to access the water leads straight up to the group of figures: Neptune, god of the sea, holding a trident and crown, mounted on a seahorse spurting water.

Its roots go back to the 12th century. \nFormer civic hospital church \nAs early as 1185, a chapel in honour of St. Blaise was built near the Gst\u00e4ttentor. In 1330, a church was built there which was closely connected to the B\u00fcrgerspital [civic hospital]. This name was given to the adjacent hospital because the citizens of the town provided for the physical well-being of those in need of care. St. Blaise is considered an advocate and patron saint of the sick. \nThe special features of the church \nSt. Blaise's Church was the first hall church built in Salzburg whose nave and aisles were of equal height. The church interior is Gothic, and separated by an ornate rococo lattice. The real gem of the church is a delicate late-Gothic sacrament shrine (around 1460), which probably once served as a reliquary.

In 1800, it was rechristened the \u201cGasthof zum Elefanten\u201d. The name actually refers to an elephant by the name of \u201cSoliman\u201d, which the Portuguese king gave to Archduke Maximilian of Austria and his bride on the occasion of their wedding. \nThe Ritzerhaus was first chronicled in 1294. Back then, it was part of the city walls, and therefore right on the very edge of the Old City. In 1620, a small gate was built here, which led to the gardens once tended by the nuns of St. Peter\u2019s Convent. Today, it is a thoroughfare from Sigmund-Haffner-Gasse to the Universit\u00e4tsplatz and known as the Ritzerbogen.

It was the most traveled road into the mountains, and to Italy beyond, making it one of the most vital north-south routes for medieval commerce. That said, local artisans and merchants also did business along this narrow city street. Pottery makers, dyers and tanners \u2013 in particular, those trades that had the greatest need for water \u2013 tended to gather here. Until the flow of the Salzach was regulated in 1862, virtually all of the imposing houses here, most of which stand to this day, had magnificent back gardens and direct access to the river. \nThe Steingasse today\nA stroll through the Steingasse is a leisurely experience, especially in the late morning when the sun illuminates the facades of the old houses so beautifully. Nowadays, there are only a few shops in this street. The wide Imbergstra\u00dfe has supplanted the narrow Steingasse as a main artery. The houses along Steingasse are now mainly used as residential buildings. Joseph Mohr, the famous poet of the Christmas song \u201cSilent Night\u201d, once lived at No. 31 Steingasse. At the end of the street, we find the so-called \u201cEngelwirtsbrunnen\u201d \u2013 an impressive wall fountain made of marble. \nThe Steingasse and the Kapuzinerberg\nThe Steingasse is the ideal starting point for a walk to the top of the Kapuzinerberg. The relatively minimal effort that goes into the hike up there is rewarded by one of the most beautiful panoramic views of the city.

Festival the major event on the classical music calendar we know today.\nHerbert von Karajan \u2013 a native of Salzburg\nAside from Mozart, this City of Mozart gave birth to yet another great musical talent: Herbert von Karajan, born Heribert Ritter von Karajan on 5 April 1908 in Salzburg. As a music student, he attended the Mozarteum Conservatory. In his later musical career, he shaped and dominated the cultural life of his native city.\nCareer with the Salzburg Festival\nThe Karajan era with the Salzburg Festival began in the post-war years. Because of his prior membership in the National Socialist Party, the Russian occupying forces actually banned him from conducting until 1947. At his Festival debut in 1948, he conducted Gluck\u2019s Orpheus, while in 1957 he directed a performance of Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio. He took over as artistic director in 1956.\nThe \u201cAbsolute Ruler\u201d of the Festival\nBeginning in 1960, Karajan no longer served as the sole director. And as of 1964, he was just one member of the Festival directorate. That said, as the \u201clast absolute ruler\u201d \u2013 or so his reputation goes \u2013 he made all the major decisions. Until his death in 1989, he continued to pull the strings at the Festival.\nAchievements and Legacy\nKarajan\u2019s primary focus was on the musical aspects of the Festival and on internationalizing the event. He succeeded in bringing top-caliber world stars to Salzburg, and with them guests from around the world. In 1960, he opened the newly built Grosses Festspielhaus. In 1967, he founded the Easter Festival; in 1973, the Salzburg Whitsuntide Concerts. In addition, he made substantial contributions in the development of musical documentation.\nWalking in Karajan\u2019s footsteps through Salzburg\nKarajan\u2019s grave at the cemetery in Anif soon became a pilgrimage site for his fans. The memory of this conductor is still kept alive at a number of other Karajan locations in Salzburg. Next to Marko-Feingold-Steg bridge, in the garden in front of the Raiffeisen building \u2013 the house where Karajan was said to have been born \u2013 there stands a life-size bronze statue of the maestro. Though in fact, he was actually born in a sanatorium on Franz-Josef-Strasse. Salzburg also named a city square \u2013 Herbert-von-Karajan-Platz \u2013 after their native son. Located, of course, in the Festival District.\nHerbert von Karajan | \u00a9 Siegfried Lauterwasser \nHerbert von Karajan | \u00a9 Siegfried Lauterwasser \nGro\u00dfes Festspielhaus - Karajan | \u00a9 Luigi Caputo \nGro\u00dfes Festspielhaus - Karajan | \u00a9 Luigi Caputo \nBirthplace of Herbert von Karajan in Salzburg | \u00a9 Tourismus Salzburg Gmbh / S.

In order to commemorate that special night, today\u2019s Silent Night Chapel was built and officially opened in 1937 on the very same site as the former St. Nicholas\u2019 Church where it was originally performed.

An educational area on the top floor is also available to host workshops and school visits.\nThe opening hours can be found on the official website.\nStille-Nacht-Museum Innenansicht | \u00a9 \u00a9 Standl \nStille-Nacht-Museum Innenansicht | \u00a9 \u00a9 Standl \nSilent Night Chapel in Oberndorf | \u00a9 Eva-Maria Repolusk \nSilent Night Chapel in Oberndorf | \u00a9 Eva-Maria Repolusk \nSilent Night Chapel in Oberndorf | \u00a9 Tourismusverband Oberndorf \nSilent Night Chapel in Oberndorf | \u00a9 Tourismusverband Oberndorf \nStille-Nacht-Museum Au\u00dfenansicht | \u00a9 \u00a9 Hermeter \nStille-Nacht-Museum Au\u00dfenansicht | \u00a9 \u00a9 Hermeter \nStille Nacht Museum Oberndorf\nStille Nacht Platz 7\n5110 Oberndorf bei Salzburg \nTel. +436272 4422", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2373, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d97e44e8-8ecb-4c59-b3b8-02dff4a62241": {"__data__": {"id_": "d97e44e8-8ecb-4c59-b3b8-02dff4a62241", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/young-salzburg/food-drink?page=2"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aef4b809-a49e-4cad-a8c7-91efa246dfdd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/young-salzburg/food-drink?page=2"}, "hash": "de5caa68ca632f20972c582b01fa683b8d94da2aa6585979daba85865a955ec7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Food & Drink\nLa Stella - modernes Ambiente | \u00a9 Andreas Kolarik \nLa Stella - modernes Ambiente | \u00a9 Andreas Kolarik \nA culinary journey through Salzburg begins at the oldest coffeehouse in Austria and ends at one of the young, off-beat caf\u00e9s.

Looking on the building from the outside, the metaphor of a wing comes to mind, exuding incredible dynamics and an absence of gravity - despite the 1,200 tons of steel and 380 tons of special glass that went into its construction.\nArt\nAt Hangar-7, art is not presented obtrusively. Rather, it is blended into the surroundings in a subtle and stylish way. This alone guarantees a unique atmosphere inside the impressive glass dome of Hangar-7, for the exhibited pieces can quite literally be seen in a different light depending on the weather or the position of the sun.\nAt Hangar-7, artists and visitors come together on an equal footing. Although it serves as a meeting place for all art lovers, the term \u201cart gallery\u201d would not do it justice as an exhibition venue. Rather, Hangar-7 is a place where artists and art aficionados can exchange ideas and inspire one another. The exhibition space is brought to life by this exchange, which stimulates the contrast between the different exhibition themes: technology in all its forms on the one side, and the equally varied art on the other.\nTechnology\nThe Flying Bulls in Salzburg are devoted to the art of finding rare historic aircraft, which they refurbish with dedication to let them fly again.\nHangar-7 was opened at Salzburg Airport in the summer of 2003, henceforth the home of the Flying Bulls. A special feature of the Flying Bulls' historic collection: the exhibits are much more than just collector's items. All of the Flying Bulls aircraft, regardless of age, are still airworthy.\nSalzburg Magazine: Soaring high: Hangar-7 \nMonday-Saturday 9 am-10 pm, Sunday 9 am-5 pm \nClosed: 22 December 2023 - 4 January 2024\nVisits for groups: prior arrangement necessary\nDogs permitted only in the exhibition area and in the Carpe Diem Lounge-Caf\u00e9.\n(Status: 05/2024)\nAdmission free \n(Status: 05/2024)\nAll areas within Hangar-7 can be accessed via a barrier-free entrance. \nB25 at Hangar-7 | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nB25 at Hangar-7 | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 Outside | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 Outside | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 in the sunlight | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 in the sunlight | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 Showroom | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 Showroom | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar 7 - Mayday Bar | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar 7 - Mayday Bar | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nLogo Hangar-7 | \u00a9 Red Bull Photofiles \nLogo Hangar-7 | \u00a9 Red Bull Photofiles \nHangar-7 | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 | \u00a9 Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nRed Bull Hangar-7 GmbH\nWilhelm-Spazier-Stra\u00dfe 7a\nTel. +43662 2197-0", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3575, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "064e5d14-5d19-4924-b470-219740b681e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "064e5d14-5d19-4924-b470-219740b681e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/young-salzburg/food-drink?page=3"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18312856-b476-4ed0-91a7-c9934bcfa171", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/young-salzburg/food-drink?page=3"}, "hash": "d3bf85baa31d426334b9515f851c50c4732058fabfe7a2586336213124f234ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Food & Drink\nA culinary journey through Salzburg begins at the oldest coffeehouse in Austria and ends at one of the young, off-beat caf\u00e9s.

The sculptures are within walking distance of the Old City and freely accessible.\nPublic Art\nThe Walk was initiated by the Salzburg Foundation in collaboration with the Foundation for Art and Culture Bonn as part of a 10-year project entitled \"Salzburg Art Project\". Each year, between 2002 and 2010, the Salzburg Foundation invited an international artist to Salzburg to design and execute a work of art for the public space. With the execution of the 10th and final arts project in October 2011 comprising three works by the acclaimed Austrian artists Brigitte Kowanz, Manfred Wakolbinger and Erwin Wurm, the Walk of Modern Art was completed.\nIn 2013, the artworks (of the Salzburg Foundation) were transfered to the International W\u00fcrth Collection, where they are now on permanent loan from the City of Salzburg. In 2017 the stone sculpture \u201cberliner block\u201d by Gerhard Trieb was added to the Walk of Modern Art and in 2019 Anselm Kiefer\u2019s \u201cThe Language of Birds\u201d completed the art project.\nWhilst every artist had taken a completely different approach, each sculpture is an interpretation of Salzburg and highlights the city's identity as a cultural centre and World Heritage site. All artists had the chance to visit the city and familiarize themselves with its history, culture and architecture before designing and executing a work of art in a public site of their choosing. By presenting their very personal interpretations, this circuit of contemporary art, which is unique in Europe, has evolved.\nIn a town steeped in tradition, it offers visitors and residents the opportunity to engage in an inspiring dialogue with contemporary art.

Under Archbishop Paris Lodron, the Palais \"Collegium Rupertinum\" served as an educational institution for aspiring priests. The Rupertinum was run as a home for children and students until 1974. \nIn 1983, the building transferred to public ownership as the \u201cSalzburg Museum of Modern Art and Graphic Collection\u201d. Over the years, the rooms of the Rupertinum were adapted and now provide an outstanding setting primarily for graphic art and photography. Major remodeling took place in 2016 and the Generali Foundation Study Center moved into the Rupertinum.\nGenerali Foundation\nThe Generali Foundation comprises around 2100 works by 250 renowned artists and is one of the biggest private collections in Austria. The extensive archives, the library and parts of the collection of the Generali Foundation were merged on permanent loan with the holdings of Museum der Moderne Salzburg and are available free of charge. \nAustrian Photography Collection\nPhotography has been collected at Museum der Moderne Salzburg since 1981. Whereas initially the holdings of Salzburg Province were administered in parallel to purchases by the Austrian Ministry of the Arts, the national collection is now officially known as the \u201cAustrian Federal Photo Collection at Museum der Moderne Salzburg\u201d and comprises around 12,000 individual titles. \nMultimedia guide \nA multimedia guide is now available in the MuseumStars app (for iOS and Android) with a wide range of information and services: \nIntroduction to art in public space \nDigital art walks \nSite plans and orientation aids\nSalzburg Magazine\nMuseum der Moderne Salzburg \u2013 one museum under two roofs\nTuesday-Sunday 10 am-6 pm, Thursday 10 am-8 pm (from 25 April 2024)\nDuring the Summer Festival and 26.12.2023-6.1.2024: additionally open Monday 10 am-6 pm\n24 Dec: 10 am-2 pm\nClosed: 25 December\n(Status: 01/2024)\nOne museum - two buildings - five exhibitions\nValid for both the Museum der Moderne Salzburg/M\u00f6nchsberg + Altstadt (Rupertinum) including the M\u00f6nchsbergAufzug Lift and panoramic view.

A particular highlight is the nativity scene with references to Salzburg. \nAn eventful history \nThe beginnings of the former parish church go back as far as the year 800. Until the 12th century, it was a double church: the upper part was reserved for the emperor and his entourage, the lower part was for the bourgeoisie. In the 18th century, it was elaborately redesigned, and now it is integrated into the row of houses of the Residenzplatz to such an extent, that its former appearance is hardly recognisable. \nWhat is special about St. Michael's church? \nThe small church is a succursal church in honour of the Archangel Michael. The main altar is adorned with a painting of the Archangel defeating Lucifer. A further highlight is the all-year nativity scene showing scenes from the ecclesiastical year: from the proclamation of the angel to the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

There, from May until the End of October, you can enjoy hikes with the whole family.\nHow the Lammerklamm was created \nThe Lammerklamm demonstrates the imposing power of nature. The narrow valley was carved out by glaciers during the Ice Age (approximately 15,000 to 30,000 years ago), while the masses of water released by the melting ice left behind a narrow gorge flanked by steep cliffs. The Lammer river gorge is one of the most impressive natural wonders in all of Salzburger Land. \nHiking in the Lammerklamm \nThe gorge has been accessible to visitors since 1884 and can be explored from May until the end of October. The secured walkways running alongside the rocky walls of the gorge make visits as safe as can be. The path leads down to the torrential waters and to some absolutely beautiful lookout points. A bridge located at a narrow point also allows you to cross over to the far side of the gorge. \nEspecially impressive: the so-called \"Dark Gorge\". Here, the water has eaten extremely deep into the rocky terrain, while the cliffs on either side come within 1 meter of each other, almost seeming to touch. As if standing beneath a roof, all you can hear is the sound of the rushing waters. \nShortly before the end of the Lammerklamm, you will need to cross the \"High Bridge\". Standing 30 meters above the water, you will have an opportunity to look back down the gorge and take in fascinating views of the Tennengebirge mountains.

During the Second World War, the building was used for state occasions and government meetings. No bombs or Allied attacks ever impacted the building, allowing it to survive in its original form, right up until today. Since 1960, the Kehlsteinhaus has housed a mountain restaurant, commanding stunning panoramic view of peaks up to 200 kilometres away. \nA Very Special Ascent \nThere is no other road in the world like the one from Obersalzberg to the Kehlstein car park. Although it only has one long bend, the road rises 800m in altitude. Since 1952, the Kehlsteinstra\u00dfe has been closed to normal road traffic. Ever since that time, a special bus has brought tourists from all over the world up to the Kehlstein car park, where the ongoing journey becomes rather adventurous. A 124-metre tunnel through the solid mountain rock takes guests to a lift, the interior of which is fitted with mirrors and polished brass. In just 41 seconds the lift takes guests up to the interior of the Eagle\u2019s Nest. \nArrival and Details \nThe easiest way to experience the Eagle\u2019s Nest is a guided bus tour that starts in the city of Salzburg. Visitors can also enjoy a foot march offering magnificent views of the Bavarian Lake K\u00f6nigssee, this takes approximately 2 housr. Those seeking a more easy-going means of getting back down can continue the journey by bus. \nThe buses and the lift also transport wheelchairs.\nEagles Nest - Good to know\nThe Kehlsteinhaus - Eagles Nest is expected to be open from the beginning of May until the end of October.\nOnly accessible by Kehlstein bus or on foot.\nThe prices can be found on the official website.\nKehlsteinhaus over the clouds | \u00a9 TR Berchtesgaden \nKehlsteinhaus over the clouds | \u00a9 TR Berchtesgaden \nbus | \u00a9 RVO \nbus | \u00a9 RVO \nbus terminal | \u00a9 RVO \nbus terminal | \u00a9 RVO \nKehlsteinhaus | \u00a9 TR Berchtesgaden \nKehlsteinhaus | \u00a9 TR Berchtesgaden \nKehlsteinhaus\nSalzbergstra\u00dfe 45, Parkplatz Obersalzberg\n83471 Berchtesgaden \nTel. +498652 2969", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2580, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc7e5dee-d9bb-4724-81e0-3aff3cdd787d": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc7e5dee-d9bb-4724-81e0-3aff3cdd787d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/excursions/liechtensteinklamm"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88ae919d-a4f4-4038-8567-7c177db754c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/excursions/liechtensteinklamm"}, "hash": "07e5999fe8736f63573422cedeb96a588f3a6ae9e5d932d848e58013da50c88f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Liechtensteinklamm\nLiechtenstein Gorge\nThe Liechtenstein Gorge in St Johann im Pongau, at the entrance to the Grossarl valley is one of the longest and deepest ravines in the Alps.

In 1875, a generous donation by Prince Johann II of Liechtenstein enabled work to make the Gorge accessible to the public. \nHighlights\nThe route leads into the gorge and back over bridges, walkways and stairs for about a kilometre, past mossy rocks and an imposing waterfall, where in fine weather the sun's rays conjure up rainbows in the spray. The \"Helix\" spiral staircase descending 30m into the depths offers an awesome experience. The hike takes around 1.5 hours. \nHow to get there\nThe Liechtenstein Gorge can be reached from Salzburg by car or public transport. Parking is free.

Unique personalities and works of art were thus left behind and forgotten in the course of history. \nWith this exhibition, the Museum of the Lost Generation aims to highlight the life's work of people who were not recognised during their lifetime.
