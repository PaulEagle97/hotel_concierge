The Mozart Residence on Makartplatz and the Mozart Birthplace on the Getreidegasse, both of which are now museums, remind us of his extraordinary childhood. Numerous concerts, festivals and guided tours keep the spirit of Mozart alive and well in Salzburg.\nSalzburg as the City of Mozart\nMozart chocolates, Mozart rubber ducks, Mozart ice cream: There is practically nothing that doesn’t sport the likeness of this city’s greatest son. As the city in which Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born and grew up, Salzburg can fairly claim the title of City of Mozart. Visitors to Salzburg will bump into Mozart around almost every corner.\nRoam the Old City in Mozart’s Footsteps! \nWhen it comes to Mozart, almost the entire Old Town of Salzburg is like museum full of exhibits. The themed walk City Walk: Mozart takes you to the most important sites of his life and legacy. Start exploring at the house in the Getreidegasse where Mozart was born. The path then leads you to the other side of the river, where you will find the main building of the Mozarteum Foundation as well as the last resting place of his father Leopold and his widow Constanze Mozart in the cemetery of St. Sebastian. Then you walk on to the Mozart Monument, which has had its place on the Mozartplatz since 1842. As a seven-year-old, Mozart gave his first Salzburg court concert in the state rooms of the Residenz, and as a musician at the prince archbishop's court, he also composed for these rooms. On a detour to the unique St. Peter's Cemetery, you can visit the grave of Mozart's sister Nannerl – on the way there you can go into the Cathedral and see the original baptismal font.\nListen to Mozart’s music in Salzburg \nAn absolute must for Mozart fans during any Salzburg visit is, of course, going to a concert.

    "text": "Mozart here, The Sound of Music there: but on the international cultural scene, Salzburg is above all the Festival Town. Every summer, the Salzburg Festival transforms Salzburg into one giant stage.\nFestival City Salzburg\n\"The entire city is a stage\" – this is how the founders of the Salzburg Festival – Max Reinhardt, Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss – formulated their intentions 100 years ago. Their wishes came true and remains so to this day: the Salzburg Festival has become one of the most important festivals for the performing arts worldwide. For several weeks in summer, this town of 150,000 inhabitants becomes the hub of the cultural world. Salzburg owes this annual transformation to the Salzburg Festival: a festival acclaimed worldwide for its exceptional musical quality. Every year, top international stars such as Anna Netrebko, Rolando Villazón and Riccardo Muti attract more than 250,000 culture enthusiasts from around the globe to enjoy opera, theatre and concerts that are second to none.\nJedermann: a classic performance and an integral part of the Salzburg Festival. It is the dream of many a theatre lover – at least once in their life – to see this play by Hugo von Hofmannsthal on the Cathedral Square. Yet they are not the only ones enthralled by this timeless piece. From speculations about what dress Paramour will wear this season, to photos of the traditional Bieranstich [tapping of the beer barrel] at the annual launch party of the premiere: Jedermann has all of this Festival City holding their breath in anticipation. No wonder, then, that every the over 2500 seats for this audience favourite are regularly sold out.\nEvents \nPerformance Venues during the Salzburg Festival\nAside from the open-air stage for “Jedermann” on Cathedral Square, the other event venues are spread out across the entire city. And, since the addition of the Pernerinsel in Hallein in 1992, even beyond. That said, the most famous remain the Felsenreitschule and the Grosses Festspielhaus on Hofstallgasse – where glittering stars of high society also make their own red-carpet appearance.\nThe entire city as one big stage\nIf you want to enjoy the Salzburg Festival you don’t necessarily need a ticket. Barely anyone can resist the hustle and bustle surrounding the Festival, while several highlights are offered to the public for free. Festival productions, old and new, are broadcast – in some cases “live” – on Kapitelplatz Square during “Siemens Fest>Spiel>Nächte”. And on opening weekend, the Festival promises a colorful program celebrating both high- and popular culture.\nThe History and Great Names of the Salzburg Festival \nThe whole city as a stage – something director Max Reinhardt was already dreaming of back in his day. Together with writer Hugo von Hofmannsthal and other cultural icons, he founded the Salzburg Festival in 1920. A series of Festival directors – including Herbert von Karajan – continued the storied history of this now classic festival.",

    "text": "Art, culture and a unique history: Since 1997, Salzburg has been a proud member of the UNESCO World Heritage List – a city of “outstanding value to humanity”. We invite you to experience it for yourself, as you pay a visit to the historical district of downtown Salzburg! \nWorld Heritage-Listed Salzburg – of outstanding value to humanity\nSalzburg isn’t just rich in sightseeing attractions. This city on the River Salzach looks back on a long history as a metropolis of the arts and culture. The cultural heritage of this city shaped by the Baroque has its origins in a vibrant exchange with its southern neighbors, especially Italy.\nSalzburg was very much a melting pot for the cultures and arts of northern and southern Europe. Even in early times, craftsmen and artists were drawn to Salzburg. Many of the baroque buildings were created by Italian architects such as Vincenzo Scamozzi and Santino Solari. There is very good reason why Salzburg is known as the “Rome of the North”. This title can also be traced back to the special status once enjoyed by Salzburg: The archbishop of Salzburg was permitted to appoint his own bishops to his four subordinate bishoprics, just as the pope did elsewhere. And until 1806, he ruled over the second largest ecclesiastical state in the world. Only Rome was bigger. The city’s sacred buildings captivate visitors from around the world with their baroque beauty. That said, the bourgeois homes of the Middle Ages and the broad, Italian-style plazas are likewise beautiful to look at. These sacred and secular buildings from different centuries have been preserved well, a major reason why Salzburg was added to the World Heritage List.\nThe historic city center of Salzburg: a walk through the centuries\nThe vibrant flair and special charm of Salzburg can best be experienced by taking a leisurely stroll through the historical downtown district. In fact, Salzburg’s “Old City” lends itself perfectly to exploration on foot. The River Salzach actually divides it into two halves: the right side, including the Linzergasse, Platzl and Steingasse, and the left side. It is this left side, the older section of the city, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, also incorporating the Kaiviertel district as well as Festungsberg and Mönchsberg mountains. \nThe city mountains shape the face of the Old City, adding to its already captivating charm. Enthroned on the Festungsberg, high above Salzburg, is the emblem of this city, Hohensalzburg Fortress, built in the year 1077. You can either make your way up there on foot, or simply take a comfortable ride on the funicular. The left bank of the Salzach is also world famous for the Getreidegasse, where you will discover the house where Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born. The city owes much of its identity as a metropolis of music and the arts to this musical wunderkind. Though not only to him: In 1920, theater director and producer Max Reinhardt founded the Salzburg Festival, thereby underscoring Salzburg’s reputation as an important center of the arts and culture. \nThe ultimate in culture: Mozart and the Salzburg Festival\nWhen the call to “Jedermann!” echoes out over Cathedral Square, you know it’s that time of year again: Festival season! It was on 22 August 1920 that Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s play was first performed on Cathedral Square in Salzburg, directed by Max Reinhardt. However, the origins of the city’s love for culture extend back much further.\nIn fact, it is generally assumed that the first opera ever performed north of the Alps was presented in Salzburg. The court of Salzburg’s prince-archbishops also had a great appreciation for music and theater. Venues included Salzburg University as well as Salzburg Cathedral. Dramatic productions included everything from medieval mystery- and Passion plays to others with a popular appeal to the middle classes. The Salzburg Festival is regarded as one of the most important celebrations of opera, theater and art in the world today.\nAs you can see, Salzburg was already a city filled with culture and open to the arts when, on 27 January 1756, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart came into this world. In Salzburg’s historical district, you will encounter traces of our wunderkind practically everywhere you go. Whether Mozart Square, the Mozart Residence or Mozartsteg Bridge – the famous son of Salzburg is ever-present in the city of his birth.\nThe Historic Center of Salzburg: on the UNESCO World Heritage List\nOnly the most exceptional natural and cultural monuments make it onto the UNESCO World Heritage List. Aside from architectural edifices and city ensembles, the World Heritage sites also include cultural landscapes, industrial monuments, and works of art such as petroglyphs. Austria itself currently boasts twelve World Heritage sites. By signing the UNESCO agreement in 1993, Austria has committed itself to protecting and preserving those World Heritage sites within its borders. The historic center of Salzburg has been a member of the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1996/1997. The protected area of the Old City spans 236 hectares and some 1,000 unique objects.",

Roam in the footsteps of Maria von Trapp and Julie Andrews!\nThe movie-worthy story of the von Trapps\nWhat sounds like a modern fairy tale is actually a true story: that of Maria Kutschera. She moved in with the Trapps as the children’s governess and shortly afterwards married the widower father of the family. In the 1930s they founded a family choir, which, after their emigration to the United States in 1939, became an international success.\nIn 1965, the touching story of this singing family made it to the movies.

The youth scene is vibrant and has developed, especially in recent years, into an exciting blend of opportunities.\n“Griass di!” – Welcome to Salzburg\nSalzburg is a city of many faces. Chic, sporty and traditional – with something sure to appeal to all types and tastes. And the city always comes at you with unexpected impressions. In the morning, for example, you might well encounter people standing in line at the bus stop who are all geared out to hit the slopes.\nAs you will guests who are here for the Festival, sporting their finest red carpet looks, perhaps being chauffeured through the streets in a rickshaw. On beautiful days, hundreds of people make themselves comfortable along the banks of the River Salzach. This city, in which 24,000 students live and are creatively active, loves nothing more than to show off its cool, colorful side.\nPubs & Nightlife\nSalzburg’s eateries and watering holes offer all kinds of opportunities to get out and enjoy. Once again, there’s a full range to choose from, from traditional to modern, from classical to off the wall. Due to the short distances and the location of the major party zones, it’s easy to get to most places on foot, which in turn means that every night dedicated to some “serious” partying promises an extraordinarily colorful mix.\nSpecial Events & Youth Scene\nEveryone knows that Salzburg “does” music really, really well. And somehow, there’s practically no way to spend a vacation here without enjoying a bit of culture, too. Many offers are surprisingly cheap or even free. From Krampus parades during Advent and free concerts put on by graduating seniors at Mozarteum University, to the always popular Siemens Fest>Spiel>Nächte in summer – the list of events goes on and on.\nOutdoor Activities in Salzburg\nThere are a number of sports you can enjoy in Salzburg that are so “way out there”, you would never have imagined they were possible.

The prince-archbishop was the leader of both church and state, a man who possessed money, power, and influence in Rome. This status was one of the reasons for the UNESCO to award Salzburg the prestigious title “World Heritage Site”. As we trace the exciting history and stories associated with Salzburg, we get to know it from its most imposing and magnificent perspective.\nIntroduction\nFor more than 1100 years, Salzburg was a church state where secular and church power were unified in the role of the prince-archbishop. Baroque squares, magnificent collections and an impressive wealth of churches and abbeys attest to the legacy of these prince-archbishops in terms of architecture, art and culture. A visit to the historic district alone, with its many buildings and towers, is a journey into the past. In addition, pilgrimage paths, theme tours and accommodations provided by religious institutions invite you to immerse yourself even more deeply in this church city.",

The Festungsberg and the adjacent Mönchsberg, the Kapuzinerberg, the Gaisberg, and the Untersberg to the south of Salzburg: All of them invite you to take a stroll, go on a city hike and do a spot of sightseeing.

Fountains in the narrow lanes and broad city squares provide refreshment in many different ways.

    "text": "Salzburg’s beer culture has a tradition dating back centuries which is continued today in the form of privately run breweries and an exceptional culture of gastronomy.\nThe History of Beer Culture\nThe first commercial breweries in Salzburg were established at the end of the 14th century. Two of the city’s oldest still exist today, and both are the epitome of knowledge passed down through the generations in combination with unsurpassed expertise: The Stiegl-Brauerei goes back to the year 1492 and is now Austria’s biggest private brewery, while Augustiner Bräu Kloster Mülln has been producing beer since 1621.\nAt the time of the prince-archbishops, beer brewing was subject to very strict regulations. Alcohol taxes also brought in lucrative revenues for the state. At the time when Salzburg was absorbed into the Austrian crown lands, new production methods and improved technology led to an upswing in beer production. By 1860, there were 75 breweries across Salzburg City and the entire province. The war years of WWI and WWII saw a drastic decline in the brewing industry. From this point on, the Salzburg market was dominated by two major breweries: Stiegl and Kaltenhausen.\nBreweries in Salzburg\nSalzburg is generally regarded as the beer capital of Austria. Eleven breweries in and around the city reflect the impressive variety of opportunities available to beer aficionados. From Stiegl Brewery and Hofbräu Kaltenhausen to venerable Augustiner Bräu Kloster Mülln, Die Weisse and those microbreweries at inns that produce only for their own guests, Salzburg gives you the perfect opportunity to experience the multifaceted world of “amber nectar”. Each brewery has its own style and specialises in a core competence. The range includes traditional Salzburg beers as well as innovative creations.\nExperience Salzburg’s Beer Culture \nThe easiest way to discover Salzburg’s passion for beer is by paying a visit to one of the pubs or restaurants operated by the breweries. Enjoy a wide range of beers at traditional inns and trendy bars. Experts in the beer culture of Salzburg share their knowledge with participants during walks, tours and courses. In addition to traditional festivities in which beer plays an important role, you can also immerse yourself in Salzburg's 600-year-old tradition of brewing beer on the \"Salzburg Beer Culture\" themed walk.\nBehind the scenes\nIngenious master brewers understand and make creative use of the advantages they enjoy as independant brewers.

Whether at work, for a stroll through the market or to attend a Salzburg Festival performance – here traditional costume is considered good form. With some 20 makers of traditional costumes and specialist stores, the town is a shopping paradise for enthusiasts.\nEnjoy shopping in Salzburg's Old Town\nOn a walk through Salzburg, it soon becomes clear: traditional fashion confidently holds its own beside international fashion trends. Traditional costume makers and creative young designers experiment with fabrics, patterns and trend colours, constantly developing the look. Today, you can wear what you like.\nSince 1946, the Salzburger Heimatwerk has been devoted to the conservation, maintenance and development of traditions. Young designers such as Tanja Pflaum from Ploom or Constanze Kurz from Hanna Trachten interpret classic traditional fashion in refreshingly unconventional styles aimed to appeal to very young target groups. The fashion-conscious will find traditional costume as high-end haute couture at stores including Madl, Forstenlechner, Trachten Wenger, Moser and Trachten Stassny. Specialists for hand-made, elaborately embroidered custom-made items are the Salzburger Heimatwerk, Trachtenmoden Lanz and the Beuerle workshop. If you don't want a completely traditional costume, you can pep up your outfit with accessories such as knitted cardigans, silk scarves or traditional jewellery.\nEvents as a platform for customs and costumes\nAt folkloric events, traditional costume is displayed in all its seasonal variations – whether traditional at the annual maypole raising in spring, formal and elegant at the opening festivities for the Salzburg Summer Festival or the Jedermann performance in the Cathedral Square, young and fresh at the Rupertikirtag [town fair] in autumn, or eclectic at the Salzburg Adventsingen.\nThe history of traditional fashion in Salzburg\nDirndl, lederhosen and jacket were once the traditional clothes worn by the rural population. Everyday wear for a woman was a plain cotton working dirndl, on feast-days and for church a festive costume of brocade, silk or velvet. With the emergence of tourism in the mid-19th century, together with the fashion for the summer retreat, traditional costume also became familiar in towns. It symbolised joie de vivre and the lightness of being, away from everyday life. This custom was enhanced after Max Reinhardt and Hugo von Hofmannsthal founded the Salzburg Festival, and it was considered chic to wear traditional costume – it was even worn on stage in Max Reinhardt's 1933 Faust production. The Sound of Music has made a huge contribution to familiarising the world with Salzburg's local costumes: whether at home or on stage, Maria Augusta von Trapp liked to wear a dirndl, and in both film and stage productions, dirndl, lederhosen and Haferlschuhe [robust working shoes] played an important role.\nProminent names continue to fill the order books of traditional businesses: Emperor Franz Joseph I, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Herbert von Karajan, Elizabeth Taylor, Billy Wilder, Pablo Picasso, Helmut Kohl, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Caroline von Monaco, Queen Beatrix, Placido Domingo, the Rothschild, Oppenheimer and Flick families, Louis Vuitton and many more famous names were or are avowed aficionados of traditional Salzburg fashion.",

However, there is a footpath to the fortress (or alternatively you can take the Mönchsberg lift).\nHohensalzburg Fortress is enthroned on the Festungsberg, high above the rooftops of the Baroque historical district. The biggest fully preserved castle in Central Europe, this emblem of Salzburg, offers a 360-degree view of the city and its surroundings.\nThe History of Hohensalzburg Fortress\nArchbishop Gebhard built the Hohensalzburg Fortress in 1077. In the following years, his successors were responsible for the further development of the fortress architecture. Around 1500, under Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach, the fortress took on its present appearance. The original purpose of the fortress was to protect the principality and the archbishops from enemy attack. In all these years it has never been taken by foreign troops.\nThe Museums of Hohensalzburg Fortress \nHighlights include the fortress’s many museums: The Fortress Museum itself shows historical exhibits focused on courtly life led by the prince archbishops; the Marionette Museum as well as the Museum of the Rainer Regiment likewise invite visitors to embark on a journey into the past. The historic armoury houses an interactive exhibition on suits of armour and weapons. Also located on the third floor of the fortress are the Princes’ Chambers, consisting of the Princes’ Hall, the Golden Chamber and the Golden Hall. The furnishings in all of these rooms are original and have remained unchanged since 1501/1502. Particularly impressive: a simulation of the night sky, consisting of gold stars on an azure and royal-blue background as well as the tile stove in the Golden Chamber. A Magical Theatre and modern media stations add an innovative touch to the experience!\nThe Panorama Tour: the pleasure of seeing \nA truly special experience the panorama tour, which leads from the salt magazine via the dungeon to the viewing platform of the Reckturm [tower], where there is probably the most beautiful view in the city. Afterwards, the tour leads through the battlements to the famous Salzburg Bull. \nVisiting the Fortress\nThe fortress is open year-round.

The building, which is under a preservation order, borders on the Mozartplatz, Residenzplatz and Kaigasse, and today houses Salzburg Museum, Glockenspiel and Heimatwerk.\nHistory\nConstruction and completion of the New Residenz took more than a hundred years. Four prince-archbishops had considerable influence on its design, yet the building is essentially \"a child of the time\" of Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau. In 1588, he had the preceding buildings demolished to make room for the new one, intended to serve as his new residence and to accommodate guests. In 1605, however, he decided to retain the Old Residenz as his domicile. \nWolf Dietrich had the main building of the New Residenz completed with the tower, and began work on the wing next the Kaigasse, which was completed by his successor, Archbishop Markus Sittikus. In 1674, Archbishop Max Gandolph von Kuenburg built the south and south-west wing, intended mainly to house the court library. The arcades were added in the reign of Archbishop Johann Ernst Thun, and the tower heightened to accommodate the famous carillon (Glockenspiel). \nThe state-rooms\nThese splendid rooms on the second floor of the New Residenz comprise the Tugendsaal [virtue], Gloriensaal, Ständesaal [estates], Feldherrensaal [commanders], bathroom and Bischofssaal. The richly stuccoed staircase is modelled on that of an Italian Renaissance palace. \nThe New Residenz today\nThe New Residenz now houses the following institutions: \nSalzburg Museum\nSalzburg Carillon\nSalzburger Heimatwerk\nCurrently, in co-operation with the Austrian Belvedere Gallery, work is in progress for the \"Belvedere Salzburg\" in the second inner courtyard of the New Residenz. Completion is planned for 2026.\nPrices \nSalzburg's Carillon:\nAdults € 4.50 \nChildren (6-15 years) € 2.00 \nYouths (16-26 years) € 2.50 \nPeople with disabilities (disability pass required) € 3.00 \nSenior citizens, groups (adults), per person € 3.00 \nGroups (max. 15 persons) € 65.00 flat rate\n(Status: 10/2023)\nAccessibility \nThe New Residence provides barrier-free access.\nSalzburg's Carillon does not provide barrier-free access.

    "text": "Mirabell Palace and its chequered history\nPrince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau had the Palace (originally called Schloss Altenau) built in 1606 for his mistress Salome Alt and their 15 children. His successor, Marcus Sittikus, banished mother and children from the palace, which he re-named \"Schloss Mirabell\" [from the Italian mirabile \"wonderful\" and bella \"beautiful\"]. Eventually, under Prince-Archbishop Franz Anton Harrach, the site was reconstructed as a baroque palace complex. Especially worth a visit is the Marmorsaal [marble hall], formerly the prince-archbishop's banqueting hall, with its marble pillars, opulent stucco and ceiling frescos. Leading up to it is the \"angels' staircase\", created by the Austrian sculptor Georg Raphael Donner. The white marble balustrade is decorated with a host of putti. \nMirabell Palace today\nToday, the Mirabell Palace houses the offices of the Salzburg mayor and the municipal administration. The Marmorsaal is now considered one of the finest wedding halls in the world. Leopold Mozart and his children Wolfgang and Nannerl performed here. Besides hosting weddings, conferences and awards ceremonies, the Marmorsaal provides an enchanting setting for concerts. \nThe Mirabell Garden – a baroque pleasure garden in the town centre\nUnder Archbishop Johann Ernst Thun, the Mirabell Garden was reshaped around 1690 according to plans drawn up by baroque architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. The basic geometrical form characteristic of the Baroque age is still recognisable. The visual alignment towards Cathedral and Fortress lends the garden a grandiose effect, at the same time incorporating it into the historic townscape. \nFeatures of special interest in the Mirabell Garden\nThe large parterre with the central fountain and the four groups of figures by Ottavio Mosto, symbolising the four elements: fire, air, earth and water. \nThe small parterre with the Pegasus fountain. The copper Pegasus figure, forged in 1661 by Caspar Gras, was commissioned by Archbishop Guidobald von Thun for a horse-pond on the Kapitelplatz. After gracing several different squares in the Old Town, the famous sculpture was placed here in 1913. \nThe Heckentheater [hedge theatre] in the western section of the garden – one of the oldest hedge theatres north of the Alps. Folkloric and other events are held here in summer. \nThe Zwergerlgarten [dwarf garden] dates from the reign of Archbishop Johann Ernst Graf Thun. Originally comprising 28 dwarfs of white Untersberg marble, it is the oldest dwarf garden in Europe. 17 of the original dwarfs are still preserved. \nThe Mirabell Garden as a famous film location\nBesides the Felsenreitschule and the Nonnberg convent, the Mirabell Garden is one of the principal settings in the Hollywood musical The Sound of Music. In the film, Maria and the children dance around the Pegasus fountain behind Mirabell Palace, singing the song \"Do-Re-Mi\". At the end of this scene, the Trapp family line up on the steps leading to the Rosenhügel [rose hill] for the finale. The unique view through the Mirabell Garden to the Palace has since become world-famous.",

    "text": "Fortress & Palaces\nLeopoldskron Palace\nLeopoldskron Palace\nPicturesquely situated Schloss Leopoldskron lies just a few minutes’ walk from the Salzburg historical district, the world-famous former family seat of one of the prince-archbishops as well as an original shooting location from the movie “The Sound of Music”. \nResidence of the Prince-Archbishop\nIn 1736, Salzburg prince-archbishop Leopold Anton Freiherr von Firmian built Schloss Leopoldskron as the family residence. Standing right next to the beautiful Leopoldskron Pond, it captivates with panoramic views of the surrounding mountain world. Because of his special ties to the palace, the prince-archbishop had his heart interred in the chapel of Schloss Leopoldskron.\nMax Reinhardt and his estate\nEurope’s most famous theater impresario, Max Reinhardt, purchased Schloss Leopoldskron in 1918. Over the course of 20 years, he restored this jewel of the Baroque to renewed glory. In those days, the palace also served as an international, high-profile meeting place for the artistic and cultural scene. Furthermore, it was here that Max Reinhardt, together with Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss, founded the Salzburg Festival.\nSchloss Leopoldskron as a movie set\nSince 1965, Schloss Leopoldskron has been well known far beyond Austria’s borders as an original shooting location for the world-famous movie “The Sound of Music”. Nowadays, it is a stopping point on many guided tours of the city, enchanting visitors with its rich history as well as its magical location. It should be noted that admission to the palace, the park grounds and its historic landmarks is restricted solely to invited guests and customers of the house.\nThe palace as an event location and holiday refuge \nToday’s Schloss Leopoldskron offers the opportunity to reside during your Salzburg visit in a truly idyllic setting on the outskirts of the city. Secluded behind the historic walls of this former princely residence are luxurious suites and rooms with an exclusive charm all their own. State-of-the-art technology, functional room amenities and personal service make Schloss Leopoldskron a popular year-round seminar- and event location for very special private as well as professional occasions.\nSchloss Leopoldskron: Cradle of the Salzburg Festival\nAccessibility \nHotel Schloss Leopoldskron is generally accessible for guests with reduced mobility. Please note, however, that the historic infrastructure may provide minor obstacles, such as door steps, uneven floors, or tight paths, which may be challenging to overcome without help. The staff will be glad to help as needed. \nImpressions\nLeopoldskron Palace and the Fortress Hohensalzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg \nLeopoldskron Palace and the Fortress Hohensalzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg \nLeopoldskron Palace in the Winter | © Schloss Leopoldskron \nLeopoldskron Palace in the Winter | © Schloss Leopoldskron \n'marble hall' | © Schloss Leopoldskron \n'marble hall' | © Schloss Leopoldskron \nchinese Salon | © Schloss Leopoldskron \nchinese Salon | © Schloss Leopoldskron \nvenetian Salon | © Schloss Leopoldskron \nvenetian Salon | © Schloss Leopoldskron \nLeopoldskron Palace in autumn | © Schloss Leopoldskron \nLeopoldskron Palace in autumn | © Schloss Leopoldskron \nsecret stairway | © Schloss Leopoldskron \nsecret stairway | © Schloss Leopoldskron \nLeopoldskron Palace and the Fortress Hohensalzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg \nLeopoldskron Palace and the Fortress Hohensalzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg \nContact\nSchloss Leopoldskron\nLeopoldskronstraße 56-58\n5020 Salzburg \nTel. +43662 83983-0 \nConsent for missing marketing cookies ",

    "text": "Churches & Cemeteries\nSt. Peter's Monastery & Cemetery\nSt. Peter's Abbey was founded in the 7th century and is considered the oldest monastery still in existence in the German-speaking world. Along with the impressive Christian architecture, St. Peter's cemetery and the catacombs are a popular tourist attraction in Salzburg.\nSt. Peter's collegiate church and monastery\nThe first Abbey Church of St. Peter was built in 696 by Rupert, Bishop of Worms. Today's Abbey Church was built in the 12th century and remodelled several times over the centuries, and today combines elements of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo styles. The historic main organ and the various chapels are particularly interesting. The museum of St. Peter and the Long Gallery are accessible via the DomQuartier. \nSt Peter's Cemetery and Catacombs\nSt Peter's Cemetery was built in late antiquity and is therefore older than the archabbey itself. Numerous funerary monuments and crypts around the late-Gothic Margarethenkapelle in the centre of the grounds make St Peter's Cemetery so impressive. Famous personalities, artists, scholars and merchants found their final resting place here. The catacombs are caves carved into the fortress hill. They are most likely of late antique-early Christian origin and did not serve as burial sites but as early Christian meeting places. International visitors recognise the cemetery and catacombs as familiar settings from the film The Sound of Music. \nMusic in St. Peter's Abbey\nMozart and Hayden are closely associated with St. Peter's Abbey. In 1769, thirteen-year-old Mozart composed the Dominicus mass for the abbot and a few years later Michael Haydn wrote the Rupertus mass commissioned by the abbey. Today, the Baroque Hall in St. Peter's Stiftskulinarium restaurant and the Romanesque Hall are regularly used for concert events such as the Mozart Dinner Concert. \nBusiness enterprises\nIn keeping with Benedictine tradition, the Archabbey of St. Peter also has several businesses. The St. Peter's Abbey Bakery and the St. Peter's Stiftskulinarium are well worth a visit. \nOpening times \nCatacombs:\nMay-September: daily 10 am-12:30 pm, 1 pm-6 pm \nOctober-April: daily 10 am-12:30 pm, 1 pm-5 pm \n(last admission 20 min. before closing) \nClosed: 1 Jan, 24-26 Dec, 31 Dec\nAlterations possible, please see notice \nDogs not permitted\nAbbey Church of St. Peter:\nDaily 8 am-8 pm\nNo visits during mass!\nSt. Peter Cemetery:\nApril-September 6:30 am-8 pm\nOctober-March 6:30 am-6 pm\n(Status: 11/2024)\nPrices \nCatacombs: \nAdults € 2.00 \nChildren/youths (6-18 years) € 1.50 \nGroups of 10 adults or more, per person € 1.50 \nSchool groups, per pupil € 1.00\nSalzburgCard: one time free admission \n(Status: 11/2024)\nAccessibility \nBarrier-free access to the church to the left of the main entrance, door can be opened with a Euro-Key.

    "text": "Impactful Contrasts\nThe history of the Franciscan Church – just as that of Salzburg Cathedral – extends all the way back to the early days of Christianity in Salzburg. Both houses of worship are remarkable because of their striking contrasts: on the one hand the cathedral, the dominating baroque church of the bishops, on the other the Franciscan Church, a slender Gothic church of the common citizenry; the cathedral, a structure intended to embody the stature of the church as an institution, and the Franciscan Church, a site for silent contemplation. \nConstruction History\nThe Franciscan Church is presumably even older than the cathedral, its construction ascribed to St. Virgil. And like practically all of Salzburg's houses of worship, it was also ravaged by fire. Its reconstruction at the turn of the 12th century also served as a symbol of Salzburg's emergent merchant sector, further amplified at the beginning of the 15th century, when the self-confident middle classes possessed the means to renovate the church. The magnificent hall chancel is an architectural masterpiece, creating the imposing contrast between light and dark which makes the Franciscan Church so unique.\nThe Treasures of the Church Interior\nThe high altar, designed in 1709/1710 by Fischer von Erlach, contains a \"Madonna with Child\" by Michael Pacher. Over the years, the ruling archbishops undertook various alterations to the Franciscan Church, including the addition of a connecting walkway to the Residenz installed by Wolf Dietrich. The interior features nine different chapels, four of which were endowed by different archbishops.\nLasting Impressions: The \"Hand of Refuge\"\nThe Franciscan Church doesn't merely unite different styles ranging from Romanesque to modern, it also possesses countless impressive details. For example, its big church bell, the Marienglocke, plays an important supporting role in summer performances of \"Jedermann\" on the Cathedral Square. And to the lower right of the entrance door, we find the \"Hand of Refuge\". Whosoever touched it was granted admission to the church, regardless of their innocence or guilt.",

    "text": "Churches & Cemeteries\nCollegiate Church\nKollegienkirche - Collegiate Church\nCollegiate Church (University Church) is one of the most important baroque churches in Austria. Built by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, it looks back on an exciting history and has gained a reputation in the City of Mozart as a venue for art and music. \nLasting Impressions: Church of Light\nThe exceptionally steep dimensions of the church interior are very impressive. By foregoing painting and very sparing use of stucco and sculptures, the space achieves its own distinctive effect. This simplicity is an ideal backdrop for art exhibitions and concerts. And if you look closely, you might well discover a scorch mark on the marble flooring. This comes from the time when Salzburg was occupied by Napoleonic troops and the church was used as a warehouse for hay. \nConstruction History\nThe Collegiate Church was built under Archbishop Johann Ernst Graf Thun as a new house of worship for the Benedictine university, which had been established in 1620. In order to oversee the project, the archbishop selected probably the most important baroque architect of that time, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. In building the University Church, Fischer von Erlach created his masterpiece. The consecration ceremonies began on 20 November 1707 and lasted eight days. The artist himself was sadly no longer able to see \"the crown of his creations\", since he had gone blind in the meantime. The chapels within the church's interior are dedicated to the patron saints of the four academic faculties: Thomas Aquinus (theology), Ivo (law), Luke (medicine) and Catharine (philosophy).\nA church with a rich history and countless stories to tell\nOver the years, the University Church was to experience a checkered history. When the troops of Napoleon's army occupied the city in 1800, the church was used as a hay depot. In 1810 – when Salzburg came under Bavarian rule – the University was closed and the church's original purpose was lost. During the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, it served both as a grammar school and as a church for the military. In 1922, the first performance of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's \"Grosses Welttheater\" took place here. With the official reopening of Salzburg University in 1964, the church was restored to its original purpose. Today, it also serves as a venue for art installations as well as concerts. \nThe Collegiate Church provides barrier-free access. The barrier-free entrance is to the right of the main entrance, via the passage to the Furtwänglerpark, accessible with the Euro-Key.

    "text": "Fortress & Palaces\nSalzburg Residenz Palace\nFor centuries, Salzburg Residenz in the heart of Salzburg's Old Town was the official residence of the prince-archbishops, serving to demonstrate their prestige. Today, the Residenz can be visited on a tour of the DomQuartier, and provides a unique setting for events.\nHistory\nAn episcopal residence was first documented in the area of today's Residenz around 1120. This mediaeval episcopal seat was extended several times before being demolished by Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich to make way for a new, Italianate building. Subsequent prince-archbishops, with the best architects and artisans of the time, continued to furnish the Residenz in magnificent style, and from this centre they directed the fortunes of the principality. In those days, the Residenz was of great cultural importance. The state-rooms were used for theatre and concert performances and for grand receptions. In 1614, the Carabinierisaal was the scene of the first opera performance north of the Alps. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, aged seven, gave his first court recital in the conference room, and some of his early works were premièred in his presence in the Rittersaal. \nAfter the secularisation of the Prince-Archbishopric in 1803, the Old Residenz was used by the Habsburgs. It was in the Rittersaal that, on 1 May 1816, Emperor Franz I received the homage and the oath of allegiance of the Salzburg estates – which marked the beginning of Salzburg's affiliation to Austria. On his visits to Salzburg, Emperor Franz Joseph also stayed in the Residenz, where he received the (later) German Emperor Wilhelm I in 1865 and Emperor Napoleon III of France in 1867, on state visits. \nThe Residenz today\nThe Salzburg Residenz has been in the possession of the Province of Salzburg since 1974.

    "text": "The Untersberg in figures \nThe Untersberg covers an area of 70 km2 – one third lying in Austria, two thirds in Bavaria, Germany. A cable car runs from Grödig/St. Leonhard to the south of Salzburg up to the Geiereck top station at 1,776 m altitude. At its highest point, the Untersberg measures 1,972 metres. \nWithin the Untersberg are many caves, mostly inaccessible, which have given rise to fascinating myths and legends. The Untersberg Museum in Fürstenbrunn shows where the famous Unterberg marble is quarried and how it is used in industry. The Untersberg offers special power spots, where the visitor may be endowed with refreshing or healing energy. The Dalai Lama called the Salzburg mountain \"the chakra at the heart of Europe\".\nThe Untersberg as recreational space \nFor sports enthusiasts, the Untersberg is a real paradise, whatever the season In summer, hikers and mountain-bikers have a wide choice of routes. In winter, the snow-covered mountain offers a 7.5km-long ski-run designed to gladden the hearts of skiers and snowboarders. Ski tourers appreciate the tranquillity of the unspoilt landscape away from the ski-runs. The entire mountain is a landscape and plant conservation region, one area is declared a water protection zone. Most of the town of Salzburg gets its drinking water from the Untersberg. \nTravel and catering \nThe bottom station in Grödig/St. Leonhard, about 10 km south of Salzburg, can easily be reached by bus (nos. 25 and 28) and trolley bus line 5. The funicular was built between 1958 and 1961 and has been regularly modernised. The cable car runs at 30-minute intervals; it takes 8.5 minutes to cover more than 1,300m difference in altitude. An easy path leads from the top station to the Gebirgsjäger [mountain infantry] monument and the Salzburg Hochthron peak (1,852 m). Besides the restaurant in the top station, the Hochalm and the Zeppezauer Haus restaurants offer the wayfarer traditional local cuisine. \nPlease note: The top station of the Untersbergbahn lies in high Alpine terrain, so appropriate clothing and footwear are absolutely necessary, and please proceed with caution. \nCurious to know more?

    "text": "Lasting Impressions\nThe cathedral is very much the centerpiece of Salzburg. Here, there is much to discover: the baptismal font, the crypt, the art installation \"Vanitas\", as well as the chest containing relics of the Saints Rupert and Virgil. In addition, many secrets are associated with the seven bells as well as the three entrance doors. If you take a closer look, you will even find 370-year-old graffiti scratched into the marble portal. \nConserving history. \nThe cathedral is a monument that needs protection and care. For that reason, a conservation fee of EUR 5,00 is collected for visiting the church (children and adolescents up to 18 free). Included in that ticket is a wide range of possibilities to experience the cathedral: audio guides and daily tours open new perspectives and during “Musik zu Mittag” (music at lunchtime), visitors can listen to the sound of organs that also Mozart played. \nMagnificent Cathedral Architecture\nSalzburg Cathedral is an imposing tribute to the Early Baroque. Visitors are greeted by the resplendent façade made of Untersberg Marble. Looking down from it are four monumental statues: Apostles Peter and Paul holding a key and a sword, as well as Salzburg's two patron saints, Rupert and Virgil, clasping a salt vessel and a model of the church. The two escutcheons at the top of the gable commemorate the two builders of the cathedral, Markus Sittikus and Paris Lodron. The Cathedral Square, with a statue of the Virgin Mary, forms the atrium – serving as the imposing backdrop for the performances of Jedermann during the Salzburg Festival as well as for the beloved Christmas Market.\nThe Treasures of Salzburg Cathedral\nThe many treasures of this cathedral include a bronze baptismal font (1311) with lions at its base (1200), in which Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Mohr, the man who wrote the words for \"Silent Night!\", were both christened. Other highlights include the imposing main organ, the cathedral gates by Schneider-Manzell, Mataré and Manzú, as well as seven bells. The three gates stand for Faith, Love and Hope, with the middle gate (for Love) somewhat larger. The seven bells also have names, ranging from Salvator (the biggest) to Barbara (the smallest). In the Cathedral Museum, you can gaze on other art treasures plucked from 1300 years of church history. \nSalzburg Cathedral and its Rulers\nThe history of Salzburg Cathedral is closely intertwined with that of its rulers, the prince-archbishops. The cathedral was destroyed by a number of fires, then rebuilt and expanded. The years displayed on the wrought-iron gates – 774, 1628 and 1959 – recall the three occasions the cathedral was consecrated.\nIts Medieval Predecessors \nThe very first cathedral was built in 767 under bishop Virgil, subsequently consecrated to Saints Peter and Rupert in the year 774. After a fire in 1167, archbishop Konrad III had the cathedral rebuilt, now more magnificent than ever, with the work completed in just ten years: now the mightiest Romanesque minster north of the Alps. The remains of these two former churches can still be viewed in the cathedral crypt.\nThe Newer Early Baroque Cathedral \nYet another fire destroyed major sections of the cathedral in 1598. Archbishop Wolf Dietrich was rather unfocused in tackling the rebuilding efforts. Only after his imprisonment and death was his successor Markus Sittikus able to complete the project. He commissioned Santino Solari to build the first example of Early Baroque sacred architecture north of the Alps. The new cathedral was finally consecrated by Archbishop Paris Lodron in 1628. In 1944, an aircraft bomb damaged the dome as well as parts of the sanctuary. In 1959, Salzburg Cathedral was finally re-consecrated, now as magnificent as ever. The cathedral seats approximately 900 worshippers.",

    "text": "Top 10\nHellbrunn Palace & Trick Fountains\nFor more than 400 years, Hellbrunn Palace has enchanted and amazed its visitors with its trick fountains. A unique experience with all kinds of surprises in store!\nA pleasure palace for Salzburg’s prince-archbishops \nSalzburg’s prince-archbishop Markus Sittikus planned Hellbrunn Palace as a never-before-seen oasis of enjoyment and leisure. This summer residence sprang up in virtually record-setting time, with construction taking only from 1612 until 1615. Master architect Santino Solari, who was also given the commission for Salzburg Cathedral, created one of the most magnificent Late Renaissance buildings north of the Alps. Visitors to the permanent exhibition \"SchauLust\" are also invited to explore the rooms and learn more about Hellbrunn's history. Loving couples who are ready to tie the knot also find the perfect backdrop here for the most beautiful day of their lives. \nInformation about dream weddings in Salzburg \nThe fountains - a spectacle quite beyond compare\nThe idyllic location in the south of Salzburg was ideal in many regards: The teeming waters flowing down from Hellbrunn mountain essentially predestined water to become a central design element. At the heart of the ground are the Mannerist “Trick Fountains”, which are quite unparalleled in the world today. Audio guides make the experience a special one: At 21 stations, listeners receive detailed explanation about the origins of this particular attraction and what mischief Prince-Archbishop Markus Sittikus was up to. Visitors have the opportunity to peek behind the hedgerows and scrutinize the figures more closely. But watch out for hidden water jets!\nRoaming through the palace grounds\nThe spacious parks and gardens of Hellbrunn Palace are partly landscaped, partly natural biotope. They are a marvelous place to unwind, take a walk and enjoy a bit of outdoor sport. Children will immediately be drawn to the big adventure playground. And in winter, too, Hellbrunn is always well worth a visit: throughout the advent period, the palace courtyard and the old driveway are transformed into a festive Advent market.\nread more about Hellbrunn Palace Grounds ...\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is Hellbrunn Palace?\nBuilt in the 17th century by Prince-Archbishop Markus Sittikus, this palace was primarily intended for enjoyment and recreation.

    "text": "Squares & Streets\nAlter Markt\n\"Alter Markt\", the Old Marketplace in Salzburg's historic city center, was already laid out as an urban trading center and marketplace in the 13th century. The square was known as Ludwig Victor Square between 1873 and 1927 after Archduke Ludwig Viktor, the youngest brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I, who moved to Klessheim Palace in 1861. \nOldest weekly market\nThe dairy market, herb market, turnip/cabbage market and the stove fitters' market were once linked to the central market. The square is enclosed by a row of stately town houses, whose core often dates back to the Middle Ages. \nThe Old Marketplace was not only used as a weekly market but also served as a festive setting for the Whitsun dance, the sword dance by the Dürrnberg miners, St. John's fire during the midsummer festival and the annual dance by barefoot bakers. The Old Marketplace also served as a venue for the annual Lent market until 1889. It spread to University Square and Residence Square after 1813 and was used for an autumn market until 1856, also known as St. Rupert's Market. The weekly market moved to present-day University Square in 1857.\nSt. Florian Fountain\nThe market fountain is located in the center of the Old Marketplace. It was built in 1488 to replace the former ornamental fountain. Its octagonal basin was built from 1685 to 1687 and is surrounded by two marble steps. Its corner columns are decorated with acanthus and rosettes as well as an intricate scrollwork grill resting on the water basin, crafted by Wolf Guppenberger in 1583. The town of Salzburg's coat of arms can be found on the fountain column and wrought iron grill. The statue of St. Florian von Lorch at the top of the fountain column was sculpted by Josef Anton Pfaffinger in 1734. \nThe buildings and their history\nToday the Old Marketplace boasts an impressive row of town houses whose core often dates back to the Middle Ages, although overlaid by early modern architecture. \nThe smallest house in Salzburg's historic city center is a rare curiosity. At a width of only 1.42 meters, it is located next to the famous Tomaselli coffeehouse. The tiny house was built to close a narrow alley between 1830 and 1860. \nThe old archiepiscopal apothecary has been located on Alter Markt since the end of the 16th century. The traditional coffeehouse, Café Tomaselli, and Café-Konditorei Fürst, whose founder invented the Mozart-Kugel chocolates, are located across from the Old Residence.\nAlter Markt | © Tourismus Salzburg/ G.Breitegger \nAlter Markt | © Tourismus Salzburg/ G.Breitegger \nAlter Markt in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

    "text": "Origins of the pleasure palace\nOn the site of the present palace, there was once a small manor house known as the “Kleshof”. It was bought in 1690 by Archbishop Johann Ernst Graf Thun, who soon began the construction of a pleasure palace to be known as the “Favorita”, according to the plans of the famous architect Fischer von Erlach. However, Prince-Archbishop Thun died in 1709 and work on the palace came to a halt. It was not until the reign of Prince-Archbishop Leopold Anton von Firmian, who also commissioned the construction of Schloss Leopoldskron, that Schloss Klessheim was completed. \nA pleasure palace in the truest sense \nThe exterior of Schloss Klessheim captivates above all with its gardens and the magnificent Triton Fountain. The plinths at the top of the main driveway are decorated with recumbent stags, their antlers studded with golden stars invoking the official crest of Prince-Archbishop Firmian himself. Aside from the baroque entranceway and the staircase, the grand banquet hall with its high dome and various examples of stuccowork is particularly worthy of note.\nKavalierhaus and Garden \nDuring the period of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, the palace was owned by Archduke Ludwig Viktor. He commissioned architect Heinrich von Ferstel to build a winter palace, that would become known as the “Kavalierhaus”. The Kavalierhaus and the main palace are connected by a tree-lined avenue. The spacious gardens feature a high wall as well as 11 small guardhouses. The visual division of the grounds into the Meierhofgarten, the “Ornamental Garden” and the “Pheasant Garden” was achieved by means of wall which stands to this day. \nSchloss Klessheim in recent history \nDuring the days of the Third Reich, Schloss Klessheim was the site of numerous parades and displays of weaponry. After the Allies’ victory, it became the headquarters of the military authorities. Since 1993, Casino Salzburg has resided in the magnificent rooms of Schloss Klessheim. Guests are captivated by the special flair of the casino, its unique interplay of baroque art and the modern world of “games of chance”.",

In total, the Open-Air Museum presents over 100 real buildings, spread across 5 distinct areas representing each of Salzburger Land’s different regions. Demonstrations of a wide range of traditional crafts as well as seasonal folk events (including an Easter market, raising of the Maypole etc.) turn any visit to the museum into a truly interactive experience.\nEnjoyment for Young and Old\nIf you prefer not to explore all of the 50 hectares on foot, you can simply hop aboard for a comfortable ride on the two kilometers-long historic museum railway, with three stops along the way. Yet another highlight of the Open-Air Museum is a tractor exhibition including multimedia displays and even a play tractor for kids to climb on and explore. Whenever the hunger in your tummy overcomes your hunger for knowledge, we suggest stopping by the “Salettl”, the museum’s own restaurant serving a delicious selection of popular dishes.

    "text": "The Architecture of the Getreidegasse\nThe architecture of the houses in the Getreidegasse is characterized by beautiful doorways, as well as by windows that become steadily smaller from the first floor up. In addition, the old houses are often decorated with important dates in their history, the names of former owners and even the eye of God. Yet another magnet for visitors is Mozart's Birthplace, which stands at No. 9 Getreidegasse. Salzburg's immortal wunderkind was born here back in 1756.\nThe Through-Houses of the Getreidegasse\nThrough-houses are very typical of the Salzburg historical district. The front and back of the buildings let directly out onto different streets, with an arcaded passageway connecting the two. Today, they often also feature artworks, art galleries and shops. The most famous of these is at the Schatz House, leading from No. 3 Getreidegasse to University Square. There, in a dark corner, you will encounter a poignant relief depicting the Madonna with the infant Jesus.\nThe Getreidegasse – a street for pleasant strolls and Shopping expeditions\nAbove all, the Getreidegasse draws visitors with its wide selection of international fashion chains, traditional shops and a broad range of dining opportunities. Aside from jewelry, folkwear, trendy accessories, antiquities, leather goods, stationery and perfume shops, avid shoppers can also pick up groceries and deli products in the Getreidegasse. A particular highlight of this street are its ornamental and often quite elaborate guild signs protruding from the building facades, high above pedestrians’ heads. The Wieber shop in the Getreidegasse is a traditional metalworking business which, among other things, still manufactures these “advertising signs” by hand.\nThe Name of the Getreidegasse\n“Getreide” is the German word for “grain”. That said, the name of this particular street actually has nothing to do with grain. In fact, it was originally called the Trabe-, Trab- or Trav-Gasse, with those names representing older forms of the verb “traben”, meaning to trot or lope along. Over the course of many years, the names Tragasse, Traidgasse and Getreidgasse gradually mutated into the Getreidegasse we are familiar with today.",

    "text": "Squares & Streets\nDomplatz & Marienstatue\nThe grand Cathedral Square lies directly in front of Salzburg Cathedral, in the heart of the baroque historic district. The statue of the Virgin Mary enthroned upon the square was built out of lead and marble in the 18th century.\nCathedral square description\nArchbishop Wolf Dietrich was the power behind the construction of the Cathedral Square. It is characterized by its architectural unity and exceptional beauty. Standing right on the square are the Cathedral itself, the Residenz (official residence of the prince-archbishops) and one wing of St. Peter's Monastery. This square connects to two other famous city squares, the Residenzplatz and Kapitelplatz, as well as through various arcades to the Franziskanergasse.\nStatue of the Virgin Mary\nIn this case, the statue of Immaculata, the Virgin Mary, was commissioned by Archbishop Sigismund Graf Schrattenbach. Between 1766 and 1771, brothers Wolfgang and Johann Baptist Hagenauer created the figure, a combination of sculpted marble and cast lead. This statue was clearly influenced by other statues of the Virgin Mary located in Vienna and Munich.\nWhen viewed from the center of the arcades of the Franziskanergasse, the classicist column is positioned in the central axis of the cathedral and shows the Virgin Mary surrounded by the angels on the cathedral façade and seems to wear the crown mounted on the building.\nCathedral Square today\nDue to its self-contained form, Cathedral Square has proven itself as the ideal venue for performances of the famous \"Jedermann\" morality play by Hugo von Hofmannsthal during the Salzburg Festival. During the summer months, the stage and audience grandstand invite you to enjoy a pleasant break amid the bustling historic district. In winter, the Salzburg Christkindlmarkt is held here, while autumn treats us to a series of events including Ruperkirtag.\nDetail of Marian Pillar in front of the Cathedral | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

    "text": "Squares & Streets\nLinzergasse\nLinzer Gasse & Platzl\nThe Linzer Gasse is known as a main pedestrian artery through Salzburg's historical district on the right side of the river. Setting out from the \"Platzl\", a small square adjacent to the Staatsbrücke bridge, this street runs parallel to the Kapuzinerberg out as far as Schallmoos. One-of-a-kind boutiques, fine restaurants and traditional hotels invite passersby to stop along the way.\nThe history of the Linzergasse\nSince Roman times, the Linzer Gasse has served as a main thoroughfare on the far side of the Old Town, and was once the most important road for travelers making their way out of Salzburg in the direction of Linz, Vienna and the northeastern lands of the Habsburg Empire. Although the catastrophic city fire of 1818 showed no mercy to the 14th and 15th century houses on the Linzer Gasse, it was later possible to restore its historic merchants' homes almost in their entirety. The focus of the Linzer Gasse has practically always been on traditional craftsmanship and artistry. A few years ago, a number of international fashion chains also became established here. \nFamous personalities\nAs a vibrant Shopping street, the Linzer Gasse has attracted many a famous personality. At no.3, for example, none less than the famous physician and scientist Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, better known as Paracelsus, lived from 1540 until 1541. Located at Linzergasse no. 7 since 1809 is the Engel Apotheke, whose most prominent pharmacy assistant was poet Georg Trakl, born in Salzburg in 1887. Right next door, at no.9, is Hotel Gablerbräu, where a memorial plaque commemorates the great singer Richard Mayr. \nHighlights of the Linzer Gasse \nStarting out from the Linzer Gasse, an imposing old gate and stairway lead us past the Stations of the Cross up the Kapuzinerberg. Once at the top, we are rewarded with incomparable views out across the entire Salzburg historical district. However, if you decide not to take this detour up the Kapuzinerberg, a visit to St. Sebastian's Cemetery is highly recommended. This picturesque secluded treasure, located in the upper section of the Linzer Gasse, was actually commissioned by Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich, intended to evoke the style of an Italian \"Campo Santo\".\nLinzer Gasse | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

    "text": "Nonnberg Priory\nNews\nDue to the renovation of the choir chapel, listening to Holy Mass or prayer times will only be possible to a limited extent. However, the church will be open without restrictions.\nBenedictine Nonnberg Abbey lies a little above the city at the foot of the Festungsberg and is famous for its Gothic architectural elements and its murals and smaller works of art. It is also here that the story told in the Hollywood production of “The Sound of Music” begins. Widely unkown is the fact that the nuns sing Gregorian Chorals every morning.\nChurch experience \nEvery morning at 6:45 am and in the evening (for detailed information, please refer to the opening hours), Nonnberg Abbey Church is filled with the sound of the nuns' choir.\nThe history of Nonnberg Abbey \nNonnberg Abbey was founded between 711-715. The early history of the convent's construction is unclear. What is known, however, is that Emperor Henry II built a Romanesque basilica around the turn of the millennium, which was consecrated to the Holy Mother of God in 1009 and has since then been the second oldest Marian church in Salzburg. Erentrudis of Salzburg was the first abbess of the Benedictine abbey. Since 1624 she has held the title of \"Landesmutter Salzburgs\" [Mother of Salzburg] and her tomb is in the crypt of Marian church. \nThe architecture through the ages \nThe architecture of the abbey is characterised by the spirit of the Gothic period, which can be clearly seen in the abundance of the rich ornamentation. The late Gothic winged altar with the statue of Mary is the centrepiece of the abbey church. Unique in Salzburg is the crypt with its free-standing columns and magnificent reticulated vault. The tomb of St. Erentrudis is in the apse. The convent is home to a crucifix from the old cathedral dating from 1300, and the famous wall paintings from the mid-12th century are the church's greatest treasure. \nNonnberg Abbey as a Hollywood model \nThe monastery gained international fame through its novice Maria Kutschera. Her abbess sent her to be a governess to the widowed Baron Georg Ritter von Trapp to look after his seven children. Shortly afterwards, Maria married the baron and founded a family choir in the early 1930s. Her story served as the model for the world-famous Hollywood film \"The Sound of Music\" and still inspires visitors from all over the world today. \nA visit to Nonnberg Abbey \nThe monastery can be reached from Kaigasse via the Nonnbergstiege staircase and from Nonntal via a narrow lane. The church as well as the cemetery are open daily from 6.45 am until nightfall (in summer until 6 pm). Visits are not possible during church services. The frescoes in the \"Paradise\" under the nuns' choir as well as the high altar can be illuminated.\nCollegiate Church open approx. 6:30 am-6 pm\nEvery morning at 6:45 am, on Sundays and public holidays at 7 am, as well as in the evening, the sounds of the singing nuns from the nuns' choir resound in the collegiate church of Nonnberg.\nSung vespers to listen to:\nweekdays 4:45 pm, Saturdays 5 pm, Sundays and public holidays 4:30 pm, before public holidays 4 pm - subject to change!\n(Listening in from November-February by appointment only)\nFor queries/pre-registration for vespers (at the latest the day before!): stift.nonnberg@aon.at \nNonnbergkirche | © Stift Nonnberg \nNonnbergkirche | © Stift Nonnberg \nInnenansicht | © Stift Nonnberg \nInnenansicht | © Stift Nonnberg \nAltar | © Stift Nonnberg \nAltar | © Stift Nonnberg \nNonnberg Priory with Untersberg | © Tourismus Salzburg / G.Breitegger \nNonnberg Priory with Untersberg | © Tourismus Salzburg / G.Breitegger \nStift Nonnberg neu | © Stift Nonnberg \nStift Nonnberg neu | © Stift Nonnberg \nStift Nonnberg\nNonnberggasse 2\nTel. +43662 841607 ",

With an elevation of 1287 m above sea level, it is an absolute Eldorado for recreational sports, hiking and nature. Readily accessible year-round, for the most part it is also suitable for children, with all kinds of opportunities for outdoor exercise, games and a bite to eat. \nSporting Activities on the Gaisberg\nIn summer, the Gaisberg is an inviting destination for road cycling, mountain biking and hiking. \"High-flyers\" love to launch themselves from the top of the Gaisberg by paraglider – while spectators still summoning the courage to emulate them look on admiringly and allow themselves to be inspired. Yet another summer highlight is the Gaisberg Race for vintage automobiles. In winter, the outdoor program includes ski touring and cross-country skiing: hiking paths and touring routes are kept nicely maintained, while the XC trails are freshly tracked almost every day.\nAn excellent map provides you with a clear, convenient overview of all cycling and hiking routes on the Gaisberg\nPublic bus No. 151 runs from Mirabellplatz, through the Gnigl part of Salzburg and straight up the Gaisberg. Once at the top, you are treated to wonderful panoramic views stretching from the city of Salzburg to the Salzburg Lake District, to neighboring Bavaria and, in the south, to the Göll Massif and the Tennengebirge. Rides on the No. 151 bus as well as on all public buses to the trailheads of local hiking paths are included with the Salzburg Card. \nDining and Lodgings on the Gaisberg\nSeveral restaurants and huts invite passersby to stop in for refreshments: including Kasnocknwirt, the traditional Rauchenbühelhütte operated by Naturfreunde Salzburg and, on the summit Kohlmayr´s Gaisbergspitz and the Goasnalm. The Zistelalm and the Gersbergalm, in addition to being first-class eateries, are also hotels. \nHere’s a tip for littler visitors to the Gaisberg: Next to the Zistelalm is a great playground. \nVisible from far away: the transmitter mast\nPerched on the summit plateau is the Gaisberg transmitter with its 100 m tall mast – erected there in 1956/57 – operated by ORF Landesstudio Salzburg. Since 1998, the mast has also been used to conduct lightning research. The mast is struck roughly 50 times a year, which means useful lightning data can be collected right there. \nThe Gaisberg is calling \nWebcam Gaisberg \nAusblick vom Gaisberg auf Salzburg und die Berge | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH / K.

    "text": "Mozartplatz & Mozart Monument\nThe Mozartplatz is located in the centre of Salzburg's Old Town, in close proximity to Residenzplatz and Salzburg Cathedral. While the buildings around the square tell many stories, the focal point is clearly the Mozart statue. \nThe story of the Mozart statue \nIn the centre of the Mozartplatz is the Mozart statue by Ludwig Schwanthaler. The statue was to be erected in 1841 on the 50th anniversary of W. A. Mozart's death. However, the unveiling of the monument was delayed by a year because a Roman mosaic had been found in the ground, which took time to recover. On 4 September 1842, the statue was ceremoniously unveiled in the presence of Mozart's sons. The Bavarian King Ludwig I was an important sponsor of the Mozart statue and donated the marble pedestal. A copy of the Roman mosaic can still be found at the foot of the statue. \nMozartplatz then and now \nThe Mozartplatz and its buildings play a significant role in the history of Salzburg. On the north side, the so-called Imhofstöckl (No. 5) houses the tourist information office. Behind it is part of the old city wall, which dates from the time of Prince Archbishop Paris Lodron. Opposite, on the south side, is the Neue Residenz, home to the Salzburg Museum since 2007. The house at Mozartplatz 8 was the home of Constanze Mozart-Nissen, Mozart's widow. On the west side, looking towards the Cathedral, are the Salzburg Christmas Museum and the famous Café Glockenspiel. Only a few steps away, the poet Georg Trakl was born in 1887.\nMozart monument at Mozartplatz | © Tourismus Salzburg \nMozart monument at Mozartplatz | © Tourismus Salzburg \nMozart monument | © Tourismus Salzburg/ G.Breitegger \nMozart monument | © Tourismus Salzburg/ G.Breitegger ",

The first section, about a kilometer in length, features imposing ice formations and is open to the public. Since it is a protected natural monument, development of the cave has been painstakingly cautious in order to preserve its unique natural beauty and ecosystem.\nFascinating World of Ice\nStepping through the imposing cave entrance, 20 meters wide and 18 high, you enter a mysterious world of ice. Aside from its enormous dimensions, the cave impresses with its ice palaces of crystalline beauty. Monumental formations glisten to amazing effect in the light of the traditional mine lamps which are issued to visitors. Winding passageways and galleries with evocative names such \"Diamond Realm\" lead you deeper and deeper into the mountain.\nGuided Cave Tours \nThe Ice Caves can only be visited as part of guided tours offered from May to October. These 75-minute tours include scientific information and historical facts about the cave. Especially on hot summer days, you will find yourself immerged in what is essentially a parallel world of ice. Incidentally, on clear days you will be able stand at the cave entrance and look out at a magnificent mountain panorama in front of you.\nRide up on Austria’s steepest gondola lift\nYou can in fact hike from the visitor center in the valley all the way up to the ice caves in the Tennengebirge mountains. Or, cut out the steep section altogether and let the steepest gondola lift in Austria carry you up to the cave entrance. Even in summer, the temperatures in the ice cave are around 0° C. Appropriate clothing and shoes are a must - and you need to be in fairly good physical condition: In the cave itself, you will have to cope with a total vertical gain of around 234 meters, which includes a countless number of stairs. That said, the silent beauty of the ice caves rewards every single ounce of effort!",

It is bordered by the New Residence with its carillon, the Cathedral, the Old Residence and a continuous row of townhouses.\nHistory\nFive squares were built under Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau: Residence Square with its richly decorated baroque fountain is probably the largest and most beautiful square. Fifty-five medieval buildings were torn down to make room for the square. Residence Square was designed according to the Mannerist plans of the Italian architect, Vincenzo Scamozzi.\nResidence Fountain\nResidence Fountain is considered to be the most beautiful fountain in the city of Salzburg and certainly deserves a closer look: four snorting horses seem to spring forth from the spouting rock. Giants rooted in the rock carry the lower basin, in which three dolphins balance the scalloped upper basin. The upper basin holds a Triton, a jet of water shooting into the air from his conch-shell trumpet. \nArchbishop Guidobald Thun, a fountain enthusiast, commissioned the fountain to be built. It is considered to be one of the most significant baroque monuments in Europe today. The work is attributed to the Italian sculptor, Tommaso di Garone.\nResidence Square today\nResidence Square is a popular venue for big sports or music events, including public airings of football games, live concerts and New Year's Eve parties. Residence Square serves as the setting for St. Rupert's Fair in September and a Christmas market during the Advent season.

It is Austria’s largest beer inn where beer is sold in stone-made pitchers draught directly from wooden barrels. A variety of delicious local snacks can be chosen from an arcade of small shops and market stalls, called the 'Schmankerlgang'.\nTips for a visit to the Müllner Bräustübl (brewery) \nThe Augustiner Bräustübl in the district of Mülln is a true institution for beer lovers. Whether you find a table is in one of the five halls or in the spacious garden, these six tips will make your \"Müllnerbräu\" visit a pure pleasure. \nFetch your stoneware mug How to get your beer: first take a 0.5l or a 1l stoneware mug from the shelves, and rinse it in the fountain by the cash-desk. This ensures it is clean and cool enough. Then pay for your beer, and you'll receive a voucher, which you hand over with your stein at the beer counter, and the stein is returned to you, full and foaming. Cheers! \nDIY Radler [shandy] Would you rather have a shandy? The we'd recommend: take a 1l mug, order a small beer and a limo [lemonade] at the cash-desk – then the mug will be half-filled with beer, and you choose the fizzy drink to fill up the shandy. Cheers! \nMüllner Bräu at home You haven't got time for a visit? No problem – you can enjoy the beer at home, too. Buy your favourite beer directly from the brewery; just follow the sign marked \"Rampenverkauf\". \nIs that really that time...? Important: there will be a timely announcement of closing time (11 pm). Then the lights go out in all the rooms – so either be ready to leave five minutes before that, or have your mobile phone at the ready to light the way... \nAn architectural treat If you take the main entrance from the car park, you may miss a real highlight – the impressive staircase from the back door in the Augustinergasse. Go along the passage past all the food stalls to find it. \nExplore the halls Don't miss this: take a moment to have a look at all the rooms with their traditional décor and \"wassail\" inscriptions. \nThe Augustiner Bräustübl Mülln – enjoy Salzburg's history with every sip\nCulinary Selection\nAustrian cuisine\nDining Spaces and Group Information \n8 rooms\nSeats per room: Stockhammersaal 242/Augustinersaal 207/Gambrinussaal 216/Rupertussaal 199/Abt-Nicolaus-Saal 152/Lehrerstüberl 40/Michaelbeuernstüberl 40/Schlappstüberl 12\nSeats in the garden: 1300\nSeats veranda: 120\nGroups welcome up to 200 persons \nAwards\nPreferred Salzburg Beer Culture Establishment\nAdditional Amenities\nChildren welcome\nDogs allowed\nPrivate parking lot\nPrivate parking for coaches\nThe Augustiner Bräustübl Mülln – enjoy Salzburg's history with every sip\nMonday-Friday 3 pm-11 pm\nSaturday, Sunday and public holidays 2:30 pm-11 pm\nHot meals until 10 pm\nClosed: 1 January, 24-25 December, 31 December\nGastgarten | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nGastgarten | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nGastgarten mit Kastanienbäumen | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nGastgarten mit Kastanienbäumen | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nJause im Gastgarten | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nJause im Gastgarten | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nSchmankerlgang | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nSchmankerlgang | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nAugustinersaal | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nAugustinersaal | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nMarmorsaal | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nMarmorsaal | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nGambrinussaal | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nGambrinussaal | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nLehrerstüberl | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nLehrerstüberl | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nRupertussaal | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nRupertussaal | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nStockhammersaal | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nStockhammersaal | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nProst | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nProst | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nJause mit Augustinerbier | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nJause mit Augustinerbier | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nAnprosten | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nAnprosten | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nBierkrüge | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nBierkrüge | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nBrauerei-Kessel | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nBrauerei-Kessel | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nLogo \nLogo \nAugustiner Bräu | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nAugustiner Bräu | © marketing concepts / shooting-star \nAugustiner Bräu Kloster Mülln\nLindhofstraße 7\nTel. +43662 431246 ",

Every Thursday, merchants from the city and surrounding communities offer regional specialties, flowers as well as arts & crafts for sale. \nMost important facts & figures about this popular weekly market\nA “weekly market for rural products” began in front of the Andräkirche back in 1906. Along with the Naschmarkt & Brunnenmarkt markets in Vienna, this weekly Salzburg market is one of the biggest and most famous in all of Austria. Starting at 5 in the morning, farmers, producers and food stands sell their high-quality specialties. Whilst flowers and plants are in high demand in summertime, in winter it is Advent wreaths and at Easter the traditional Easter Palms which are the hottest commodities at the market’s some 190 different stands. Whenever you happen to be in the mood for a bite to eat, we recommend ordering a mouthwatering rotisserie chicken, a clear fish broth or a typical Salzburg snack at a sausage stand. \nBut where does the name of this famous market actually come from? \nA so-called Schrannenhalle once stood on Mirabellplatz and on Schrannengasse, and was originally used as a central grain storage depot. \nPopularity of the Schranne \nSince its beginnings, the Schranne has enjoyed great popularity, which is also reflected in the allocation of stands: Generally, vendors have to wait as much as ten years before they get one.\nRead more: A Morning at the Schranne\nThursday 5 am-1 pm\nNote:\nIf Thursday is a public holiday (also applies to 24 and 31 December): Wednesday from 5 am-1 pm.\nIf 24 and 31 December are a Wednesday: Tuesday from 5 am-1 pm.\nIf 24 December is a Tuesday, the Schrannenmarkt is cancelled that week.\nSchranne in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nSchranne in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nSchranne | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nSchranne | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nSchrannenmarkt\nRund um die Ändräkirche/Mirabellplatz",

    "text": "How the \"Dance Master's House\" got its name\nWe can trace the history of this house at No. 8 Makartplatz back to 1617. Actually, until 1685 it actually consisted of two buildings. It was first referred to as the \"Dance Master's House\" in 1713: since 1711, a certain Lorenz Spöckner had been offering dancing lessons there for the nobility, in preparation for their life at court.\nThe Mozarts move in\nFriends of the Spöckner family, the Mozarts moved into their apartment in 1773, shortly after their third journey to Vienna. The house on the Getreidegasse where Mozart was born had simply become too small for the family or to host social gatherings appropriately. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart lived at the house on Makartplatz until he moved to Vienna in 1781. His mother died in 1778 and sister Nannerl got married in 1784, moving to St. Gilgen. The father first lived alone in the apartment – and from 1785 with his grandson Leopold Alois Pantaleon, who had been entrusted to his care.\nDestruction in the second world war and reconstruction\nAfter Leopold Mozart's death on 28 May 1787, the house saw several owners. On 16 October 1944, two thirds of the building was destroyed in an air raid. The part that had survived was bought by the International Mozart Foundation in 1955. An office building was constructed on the site of the ruins, which the Foundation also bought up in 1989. After it had been demolished, the Mozart Residence was reconstructed true to the original building plans.\nThe museum at the Mozart Residence\nOn 26 January 1996, the Mozart Residence celebrated its reopening. In the museum, you can see – in addition to Mozart's pianoforte – many original documents and portraits. The exhibition provides an array of interesting facts about the history of the house, Mozart’s Salzburg years and the life of the Mozart family. A multi-vision show as well as rotating exhibitions, concerts and talks offer a very rich and diverse Mozart experience.\nYou should allow yourself about one-and-a-half hours to discover the Mozart Residence. With the Salzburg Card, you will be admitted for free. \nThe Magic Flute House \nThe story behind this shed harks back to the year 1791, when Mozart is said to have composed his famous work The Magic Flute in it. At that time it was standing in the garden behind the Freihaustheater in Vienna, where the opera was first performed in September of 1791. In 1873, through the initiative of the Mozarteum Foundation, the little house was moved to Salzburg. \nAfter an extensive renovation process in the summer of 2022, the small wooden house stands in the courtyard of Mozart's Residence and incorporated into the museum as a fixed attraction. In the course of the renovations, the house was repainted in the same green as in Mozart's times.",

From its headquarters at No. 26 Schwarzstrasse, this private non-profit organization fosters contacts with some 100 Mozart communities worldwide. Its activities are focused on three core areas: concerts, museums and research.\nMozart Week - the festival for Mozart- and music fans\nThe highlight of Mozarteum Foundation Salzburg’s musical program is “Mozart Week”. At around 30 orchestral, chamber and soloist concerts the world’s best Mozart interpreters perform classical as well as contemporary music. We invite you to celebrate along with Mozarteum Foundation Salzburg during the days on and around the birthday of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart on 27 January. An event which, for good reason, is acclaimed as the leading Mozart festival on the international stage.\nSeasonal concerts – delights for the ears of chamber-music fans\nThe small, finely programmed concert formats of the Mozarteum Foundation have become real audience favourites - \"after work\", \"Klassik pur\", \"Museum Concerts\", \"Music and Word\", \"Sofa Concerts\" and the contemporary \"Im Dialog\". In these various formats, young stars and established fixed stars of classical music invite the audience on a journey through sound from the Renaissance to the present day. Here Mozart meets many fellow composers, creating exciting musical dialogues across the centuries. \nMozart museums in Salzburg\nMozarteum Foundation Salzburg also runs the museums located at Mozart’s Birthplace and the Mozart Residence. Unique original pieces together with a modern museum experience allow you to walk in Mozart’s footsteps. Tip: Free admission with the Salzburg Card!\nResearch at Mozarteum Foundation Salzburg\nThe Digital Mozart Edition is a meta-search engine. Its contents (pieces of music, sources, libretti, letters and texts related to Mozart) can be accessed free of charge worldwide for scientific, private and educational purposes. In addition, the Foundation manages an impressive collection of autographs as well as the famous Bibliotheca Mozartiana – the most extensive Mozart library in the world with around 35,000 books and articles and more than 6000 scores.",

Outstanding faculty and the unique architecture add to this institution’s appeal for Austrian and international students.\nHistory of Mozarteum University\nThe roots of Mozarteum University go back to the year 1841. The Salzburg Cathedral Music Society and Mozarteum were founded on the 50th anniversary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s death. Initially, the music school was intended to groom the next generation of musicians who would be serving at Salzburg Cathedral. Over time, such prominent figures as Carl Orff and Nikolaus Harnoncourt would leave their own mark on the Mozarteum. In 1988, the former music school was elevated to university status.\nCourses of Study\nThe Mozarteum University offers courses in music, drama, directing, opera, stage design, music, dance, art education and the liberal arts. Around 2,000 students can choose from more than 70 degree programmes. Some 550 teachers, including many famous performers, pass on their knowledge. The Mozarteum has a very international focus, clearly reflected in the teaching staff as well as the student body. Fellowship programs as well as concert exchanges foster close ties between the university and other musical and artistic educational institutions.\nConcerts & Events\nFor so much young talent, you clearly need a befitting stage! With over a hundred dates per month, Mozarteum University is one of the biggest event organizers in Salzburg.

    "text": "19 July – 31 August 2024\nThe Salzburg Festival is one of the world's most important festivals for opera, music and drama. The wide-ranging programme includes classics and world-famous artists as well as a varied programme for young people.\nThe 2024 Salzburg Festival programme\nThe Salzburg Festival, covering 44 days, presents a varied programme with 172 performances held in 15 venues. Opera highlights include Prokofiev's The Gambler, Mozart's La Clemenza di Tito and Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann. Drama, besides a new production of Everyman [Jedermann], presents performances based on plays by Stefan Zweig, Thomas Mann, Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. Under the motto \"Et exspecto\", the 2024 Ouverture Spirituelle focuses on the comfort of hope and the uncertainty of expectation.\nOpera\nThe 2024 opera productions centre on people in revolt. Different aspects of revolutionary characters are shown in Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann, Prokofiev's The Gambler, Weinberg's The Idiot, and Mozart's Don Giovanni and La Clemenza di Tito. Five operas will also be presented in concert performance.\nDrama\nIn three focal areas, Marina Davydova, the new Director of Drama, places human beings in relation to transcendence, their own history and their bodies. She takes texts based on Stefan Zweig, Thomas Mann, Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, and integrates dance into the drama. The new production of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Jedermann (the play at the heart of the Festival's founding) is awaited with keen interest – particularly in Philipp Hochmair in the title role and Deleila Piasko as his paramour. The programme also features a performative discussion with an artificial intelligence named Morpheus, and a reading by Michael Maertens from letters written by Alexei Navalny from prison.\nConcert\nThe 2024 concert programme is marked by major anniversary celebrations. The \"Time with...\" series is devoted to Arnold Schoenberg, whose 150th birthday falls in 2024. The Vienna Philharmonic performs five concerts, conducted by Herbert Blomstedt, Andris Nelsons, Riccardo Muti, Gustavo Dudamel and Yannick Nézet-Séguin. Visiting ensembles in the Guest Orchestra series include the Orchester Utopia, Monteverdi Choir, English Baroque Soloists, Collegium Vocale 1704, West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, Berliner Philharmonic, Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra and ORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. Further items on the Summer 2024 programme are the \"Ouverture Spirituelle\", Mozart Matinees, lieder recitals, chamber and church concerts.\n\"jung & jede*r\" – The Salzburg Festival youth programme\nThe youth programme features 53 performances ranging from music theatre to drama, interactions and Young Art, with in-depth opportunities for communication. 2024 will also see \"Festival mentoring\", where experienced Festival visitors introduce young adults to the world of the Festival. In addition, the opera camps for children and young people aged 9 – 17 enjoy great popularity.\nOnline Tickets \nPackages\nKartenbüro der Salzburger Festspiele \nHerbert von Karajan Platz 11 \nPostfach 140 \nA-5010 Salzburg \nTel. +43662 8045-500 ",

    "text": "The DomQuartier tour offers an incomparable combination of 1300 years of reigning power, art, music and architecture. \nState-rooms in the Residenz\nOver centuries, the Old Residenz was the official seat and prestigious headquarters of the prince-archbishops. The state-rooms reflect two centuries of art and design history, from the Renaissance through the Baroque, to Classicism. In addition, they are an authentic experiential place in Salzburg's musical history: The first opera north of the Alps was performed in the Carabinierisaal. Wolfgang Amadé Mozart gave his first Salzburg court concert in the Konferenzzimmer at the age of seven. As court musician to the prince-archbishop, he composed for these rooms and performed in them himself - they were, along with the cathedral, his immediate sphere of professional activity. \nResidenzgalerie\nThe Residenzgalerie, founded in 1923, holds alternating exhibitions of 16th-19-century masterworks of Dutch, Italian, French and Austrian painting. \nCathedral archway terrace \nThe Cathedral archway terrace, which links the Residenz with the Cathedral, offers an incomparable view of the baroque heart of Salzburg. The transformation of Salzburg into a prestigious baroque city with Italian flair began around 1600 under Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau and was continued and completed by his successors. A digitally animated video depicting Salzburg's architectural history is on display in the cathedral archway.\nNorth Oratory\nIn four adjoining rooms in the North Oratory of the Cathedral, alternating exhibitions are held. The stucco-work dates from 1628, the year the baroque Cathedral was consecrated. Of particular interest is St Rupert's Oratory, where the altar and ceiling paintings show scenes from the life of St Rupert. \nCathedral organ loft\nThe DomQuartier tour leads through the main organ loft, offering splendid a view of the entire interior of the Cathedral – one of the most magnificent monumental buildings of the Early Baroque. \nCathedral Museum\nThe Cathedral Museum in the South Oratory, opened in 1974, shows art treasures from 1,300 years of ecclesiastical history. Its chief exhibit is the Cathedral treasure. Precious liturgical objects such as chalices, monstrances and chasubles are on display, as well as Gothic and Baroque paintings and sculptures from Salzburg's churches and monasteries. The most outstanding exhibit is the Cross of St Rupert, the largest surviving early mediaeval metal cross. It is considered one of the oldest known Christian works of art in Austria. \nCabinet of Curiosities\nThe Cabinet of Curiosities, installed by Prince Archbishop Guidobald Graf Thun, was designed to impress not only state visitors with exotic or bizarre objects from the spheres of art, nature and technology, thus demonstrating the territory's wealth. The marble floor, ceiling stucco and showcases are all original. In 1974, purchases and loans enabled the reconstruction of the Cabinet of Curiosities in the style of a baroque Wunderkammer. \nLange Galerie\nThe 70m-long Lange Galerie, decorated with elaborate ceiling stucco, is considered one of the earliest gallery buildings north of the Alps. Until secularisation in 1803, it served to exhibit the archiepiscopal painting collection. Hanging here today are large-scale paintings from the art collection of St Peter's Archabbey. \nSt. Peter's Museum \nSt. Peter's Museum, in the Wallis wing of the building, presents selected art treasures from the collection of St Peter's Archabbey, the oldest monastery in the German-speaking world. Alongside liturgical instruments, paintings and musical instruments, the \"Mitra pretiosa\" (ca. 1480), richly decorated with precious stones and pearls, is one of the jewels in the crown of St Peter's Treasury.\n10 years of DomQuartier \nDomQuartier will celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2024 with a series of anniversary events. Here are the highlights: \nExhibition \"Holy Places - Views by Hubert Sattler\" in the North Oratory of the Cathedral, from 8 March 2024\n50th Anniversary of the Cathedral Museum, 6 April 2024\nPresentation of the 3D demonstration of the building history of the area around Salzburg Cathedral and Residenz on World Heritage Day, 18 April 2024\nOpen day with Venetian polychoral music in the DomQuartier, 11 May 2024 \nExhibition \"The Colours of La Serenissima: Venetian masters from Titian to Canaletto\" in collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna, from 21 June 2024 \nVenetian Festival in and around the Residenz, 31 August 2024 \nPresentation of the restored Rupertus Cross on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Cathedral Museum, 24 September 2024",

    "text": "July 20 - August 28, 2024\nIt is practically impossible to imagine the Salzburg Festival without its “Jedermann”. Hofmannsthal’s “play about the death of a rich man” has never failed to captivate audiences – especially when performed in the perfect setting right outside Salzburg Cathedral.\nThe history behind the writing of “Jedermann” \nHugo von Hofmannsthal’s “Jedermann” is based on the tradition of medieval mystery plays, especially that of “Everyman”, an English mystery play dating back to the 16th century. The stage play “Jedermann” was first performed on 1 December 1911 at Berlin’s Schuhmann Circus, under the direction of Max Reinhardt. It was also he who produced its premiere at the Salzburg Festival on 22 August 1920 – marking the birth of the Festival itself. Except for a few years’ hiatus, “Jedermann” has been performed annually at the Salzburg Festival ever since – the undisputed highlight of Festival season.\nThe Plot of “Jedermann”\nHofmannsthal’s morality play tells a virtually universal story: God sends Death in order to summon the rich bon vivant Jedermann. In his hour of greatest need, he is abandoned by his friends, his money and his lover. Only after he has repented for his transgressions and committed himself to Christianity, may he stand armed with his faith and his good deeds before the divine judgment seat.\nSalzburg Cathedral Square as Open-Air Stage\nTraditionally, “Jedermann” is performed outdoors, on Cathedral Square in front of the cathedral entrance. A place seemingly predestined as the stage and backdrop for this religious play. When the cathedral façade is cast in the evening light, the monumental statues of the saints automatically become a powerful part of the set itself. An iconic atmosphere indeed, with which the Grosses Festspielhaus – which serves as a stand-in should the weather not cooperate, and despite its better acoustics – simply can’t quite compare.\nFamous “Jedermann” Stars\nThe cast of “Jedermann” has always read like a “Who’s Who” of the German-speaking theater world. Enthralling the public in the title role have been such stage greats as Klaus Maria Brandauer, Academy Award winner Maximilian Schell and, the longest-serving Jedermann of them all, Peter Simonischek. “Paramour” has been performed by the likes of Christiane Hörbiger, Senta Berger and Veronica Ferres.\nDates & Tickets\nJedermann 2024: Philipp Hochmair (Jedermann), Deleila Piasko (Buhlschaft), Ensemble | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Philipp Hochmair (Jedermann), Deleila Piasko (Buhlschaft), Ensemble | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Philipp Hochmair (Jedermann), Kristof Van Boven (Mammon) | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Philipp Hochmair (Jedermann), Kristof Van Boven (Mammon) | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Philipp Hochmair (Jedermann), Andrea Jonasson (Jedermanns Mutter) | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Philipp Hochmair (Jedermann), Andrea Jonasson (Jedermanns Mutter) | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Christoph Luser (Teufel) | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Christoph Luser (Teufel) | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Philipp Hochmair (Jedermann) | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Philipp Hochmair (Jedermann) | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Philipp Hochmair (Jedermann), Kristof Van Boven (Mammon) | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann 2024: Philipp Hochmair (Jedermann), Kristof Van Boven (Mammon) | © Salzburger Festspiele / Monika Rittershaus \nJedermann Cast 2024\nDominik Dos-Reis - Death\nPhilipp Hochmair - Everyman\nAndrea Jonasson - Everyman's Mother\nChristoph Luser - Everyman’s Good Companion / Devil\nKathleen Morgeneyer - A Poor Neighbour / Deads\nJoseph Lorenz - A Debtor\nNicole Beutler - The Debtor’s Wife\nDeleila Piasko - Paramour\nChristoph Krutzler - Fat Cousin\nDaniel Lommatzsch - Thin Cousin\nKristof Van Boven - Mammon\nJulia Windischbauer - Faith\nCreative Team 2024\nRobert Carsen - Director, Sets and Lightning\nLuis F.

    "text": "The life story of musical wunderkind Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has its origins here in Salzburg. His parents, Leopold Mozart and Anna Maria Pertl, laid the foundation for his musical career. His early death at the age of just 35 shook everyone, but especially his sister “Nannerl”.\nA wunderkind known as “Wolferl”\nOn 27 January 1756, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is born in the “Hagenauer Haus” (No. 9 Getreidegasse) in Salzburg. Of their seven children in total, Leopold Mozart, musician to the court of the prince archbishop, and wife Anna Maria Walpurga have only one other who survives: Mozart’s elder sister Maria Anna, nicknamed “Nannerl”. Both of them are exceptionally gifted, one reason why the father puts his own career somewhat on the back burner.\nThe travels of young Mozart\nBeginning in 1762, the ambitious father presents his talented children before princely courts across Europe. At the tender age of just six, little Mozart embarks on a long journey through Western Europe – from Germany, Belgium and France, all the way to London. He would continue to develop his musical skills in Italy.\nThe Salzburg Years\nMozart spends his youth as an honorary, and from 1772 as a salaried concert-master at the Salzburg court in the service of two Salzburg prince archbishops: Sigismund Graf Schrattenbach (reigned 1753-1771) and Hieronymus Graf Colloredo (reigned 1772-1803). The court musician works in the state rooms of the Residenz and the Cathedral. His fruitless search for a different appointment leads him to Italy, Vienna and Munich. In autumn 1773, the family moves into the house on Hannibalplatz, now known as the “Mozart Residence” whose address today is No. 8 Makartplatz.\nBreak with the Salzburg Archbishop\nWith Salzburg gaining a new ruler in 1772, Mozart is once again able to lead a more ordered life. Under Archbishop Hieronymus Graf Colloredo, in 1779 he reenters court service as an organist. However, after the premier of “Idomeneo” in Munich at the beginning of June 1781, Mozart falls out with the archbishop.\nMove to Vienna and starting a family\nIn Vienna, he tries to make his way as a freelance performer, opera composer and teacher. On 4 August 1782, against the will of his father, he marries Constanze Weber. Together, the couple travel to Salzburg and Prague. Of their six children, only Karl Thomas and Franz Xaver Wolfgang survive beyond childhood.\nMozart’s Early Death\nOne of his last operatic successes is “La Clemenza di Tito” (K 621), the “Coronation Opera” first performed in Prague on 6 September 1791. Shortly after the premier pf “The Magic Flute” (K 620) at the Freihaustheater in Vienna, Mozart falls ill. He dies in Vienna on 5 December 1791 at the age of 35 from a “extreme miliary fever”. His “Requiem” (K 626) remains uncompleted.\nMozart statue on the Mozart square in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg \nMozart statue on the Mozart square in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg \nMozart Ball | © Tourismus Salzburg \nMozart Ball | © Tourismus Salzburg \nMozartplatz in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg \nMozartplatz in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg ",

    "text": "About the Salzburg Festival\nGreat names for a magnificent festival. The story of the Salzburg Festival is closely tied to names like Max Reinhardt, Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Herbert von Karajan.\nThe History of the Salzburg Festival\nThe idea of creating a festival in Salzburg as an extension of a centuries-old theatrical tradition first surfaced towards the end of World War One. It was driven by well-known personalities of that time, and especially director Max Reinhardt, writer Hugo von Hofmannsthal and composer Richard Strauss. The Salzburg Festival itself was born on 22 August 1920, with a performance of “Jedermann” on Cathedral Square. Concerts and operas would soon be added to the program.\nOne of the World’s Greatest Music Festivals\nThough one of the most prestigious music festivals in the world today, the Festival has also gone through difficult times. During the Second World War, the future of the Festival seemed very bleak indeed. The fact that, in the post-war years, things rapidly returned to normal, allowing the Festival to continue its development into the multi-week event of today – is very much due to the tireless dedication of the Festival directors.\nThe Makers of the Salzburg Festival\nOne of these distinguished himself above all: Herbert von Karajan. From the beginning of his involvement with the Festival until his death in 1989, he shaped the Salzburg Festival like no other: from internationalization of the event to construction of the Grosses Festspielhaus, and the founding of the Easter Festival. His successors, including names such as Gerard Mortier, Peter Ruzicka and Alexander Pereira, had some big, and not always easy shoes to fill.\nTraditional meets Modern\nAs we see, the Salzburg Festival proudly looks back on a long history – though has long since had its feet planted firmly in the present. Despite a huge respect for tradition, the repertoire is continuously being expanded: from a musical focus on Mozart and Strauss to brand-new contemporary works. Allowing the Festival to speak to a broad spectrum of different audiences, with something certain to appeal to practically everyone.\nHave we sparked your curiosity?

Salzburg’s most famous son came into this world on 27 January 1756. His family actually lived here for 26 years, from 1747 on, occupying an apartment on the third floor. With parents Leopold and Anna Maria as well as sister \"Nannerl\", Mozart spend his childhood and much of his youth there. In 1773, the family moved to the house we know today as the \"Mozart Residence\", on the Makartplatz Square. \nMuseum and \"pilgrimage site\"\nThe famous composer's birthplace continues to be a magnet for Mozart fans and history buffs from around the world. It was actually the International Mozarteum Foundation which first opened a museum in the house back in 1880. Constantly developed and expanded, this year-round museum is an absolute must for every Salzburg visitor.\nWalking tour through Mozart's times\nThe museum invites you to take a tour lasting about an hour through original rooms. Also amble through a middle-class apartment reconstructed as authentically as possible. Discover items of everyday life as well as furniture from the 18th century, and feel as if you have personally been transported back to the days of Mozart! \nUnique and original exhibition pieces\nOriginal certificates, letters and memorabilia document Mozart's life in Salzburg. A collection of portraits, mostly done during Mozart's lifetime, allows you to experience this musical genius face-to-face. A particular joy for Mozart fans: the historical instruments, including Mozart's own violin and clavichord.\nThe many faces of Mozart\nThe childhood of this wunderkind, the long years of traveling, and his mysterious death: the museum at Mozart's Birthplace casts light on the man and artist from many different perspectives. On the first floor, a rotating annual exhibition always has a fresh appeal to even the best-versed Mozart admirers.\nArt project “Flying Notes. K.265.” \nSince the end of March 2024, Mozart's musical notes have been dancing across the façade of Mozart's birthplace. The work by Salzburg artist Andreas Feldinger is based on an original Mozart autograph and shows an excerpt from the work \"Ah, vous dirai-je Maman KV 265\", better known worldwide as \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\". The transparent, gleaming red notes on white canvas produce accents on the famous façade and the Getreidegasse, depending on the position of sun and wind. “Flying Notes.

    "text": "The history of the Christkindlmarkt in Salzburg\nThe origins of the famous Salzburg Christmas market go all the way back to the late 15th century. Back then, the so-called “Tandlmarkt” would be held on Cathedral Square in the heart of the city, offering a wide range of goods for the locals to buy. By the 17th century, this Advent market had been christened the “Nikolaimarkt” – that is to say, the “Saint Nicholas’ Market”. For two weeks before and two weeks after St. Nicholas’ Day (on 6 December), a variety of products were offered for sale on and close to Cathedral Square: from a delectable selection of foods, to dolls and all kinds of bric-a-brac. The \"Nikolaimarkt\" was one of the most famous Advent markets of its day, second only to the ones in Vienna, Paris, Amsterdam and Nuremberg. From 1903 until the early 1930s, the Christmas market was restricted to the area adjacent to the cathedral arches.\n50th anniversary: Christmas Market with Unique Atmosphere\nThe Salzburg Christkindlmarkt, as it is known today around the world, has existed since 1974. Every year, the market is officially opened with befitting pomp and circumstance on the Thursday preceding the first Sunday in Advent, closing its shutters for the final time on 1 January. Local folk customs and traditional decorations for the Christmas tree, gifts for big and small, incense to help conjure up a festive atmosphere in your own home, all kinds of delectable treats in the form of Austrian specialties, mulled wine and hot punch: At the Christmas market on Salzburg’s Cathedral Square, you will discover practically everything you could possibly wish for. This famous Advent market draws countless visitors every Christmas season, and is also very popular with the locals, too. Not least because of the traditional huts and unique atmosphere, along with specially designed lighting that stretches above the market stands like romantic stars across the night sky.\nEvents at the Salzburg Christkindlmarkt\nThe Christkindlmarkt isn’t only a location for around 100 market stands. The organizers have also ensured that visitors are treated to a colorful daily events program: readings of Christmas stories for children, Krampus parades, guided Christmas tours, choral concerts, visits by the “Christ Child”, festive melodies performed from the surrounding towers, and so much more.\n“Sing-Along” in a choir open to singers from the general public – every Tuesday from 6 – 8 p.m.\nTraditional wind music – performed high above the square every Wednesday at 6 p.m. and every Thursday and Saturday at 6:30 p.m.\nVisit of the Salzburg “Christ Child” with his angels – every Sunday, 4 p.m.\nChildren’s reading with the “Christ Child” – every Wednesday at 4 p.m.\nThe traditional Christkindlmarkt becomes the stage for the turn of the year as a New Year's Eve market \nAn exciting supporting programme will shorten the waiting time for the turn of the year (details to follow). Punctually at midnight, the new year is welcomed with a festive fireworks display. On January 1, the gastronomic huts of the market will be open until 6 pm. \nChristkindlmarkt Stories in the Salzburg Magazine\nThe Christ-child's helper: Wolfgang Haider\nThe sound of Christmas\nA culinary journey through the Christmas market",

    "text": "Advent & Silent Night\nSalzburg Advent Singing\nAdvent in Salzburg simply wouldn’t be the same without Advent Singing. For over 75 years, folk music, small vocal ensembles and Alpine melodies carrying a message of peace have enchanted audiences and sparked the Christmas spirit in everyone.\nHistory of the Salzburg Advent Singing\nIn 1946, Salzburg singer and musician Tobias Reiser invited friends and acquaintances to the first Christmas carol concert. The event grew in popularity from year to year, and in 1950 it moved to the Kaisersaal of the Salzburg Residenz, in 1952 to the Great Hall of Salzburg University, and in 1960 to the newly built Large Festival Hall, where it still takes place today. Initially, the focus was on singing and music, but later readings and theatre performances were added to the programme.\nSalzburg's second largest Advent singing event, the Salzburger Advent® in St. Andrä Church on Mirabellplatz, was founded in 1991. The Salzburger HirtenAdvent in the Great Hall of the University was founded in 2006.\nThe Salzburg Advent Singing as a genre of its own\nWhat began as a Christmas carol concert carol in 1946 has evolved over the decades to become a genre in its own right, serving as a model for many Advent Singings in German-speaking countries. The combination of traditional songs, alpine melodies, readings and scenic performances has become an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.\nThe Salzburg Advent Singing events at a glance\nMore Advent music and Advent stories",

    "text": "Around Saint Nicholas’ Day on 6 December will take place numerous traditional Krampus and Perchten parades in Salzburg. Sporting hand-carved wooden masks, shaggy pelts and heavy bells, these wild figures are said to scare away the dark spirits of winter. A living example of centuries-old folk customs.\nWild and Eerie Characters: Krampus- and Perchten Parades in Salzburg\nThe wild jangling of bells, shaggy pelts, curved horns and terrifying masks: When Krampus and Perchten run down the street, growling, half dancing, half stamping, every single spectator is left just a little unsettled. Krampus- and Perchten parades truly are an unforgettable experience, as much a part of Salzburg’s Christmas season as the famous Christkindlmarkt and the almost meditative Advent Singing. From the end of November until the beginning of December, you can also experience this unique folk custom in the City of Salzburg itself. While no one would claim Perchten parades are peaceful, they will definitely leave you with lasting memories. An ancient tradition you can only experience in this part of the Alpine world.\nFiendish Figure: Krampus\nKrampus- and Perchten parades look back on a long tradition in Austria. That said, Krampus and Percht are far from being identical figures. In Alpine tradition, Krampus is a devil-like creature who accompanies Saint Nicholas on 6 December. In contrast to St. Nick’s gift bearers, Krampus comes along with chains and a switch, looking for those children who weren’t as good as they ought to have been in the past year. It is said that “Krampus” got his name from yet another attention-getting feature, his long claws. “Grampa” is the Italian word for “claw”. The Krampus tradition existed throughout the Habsburg empire and in neighboring regions.\nPercht, Schönperchten and Schiachperchten\nPerchten, for their part, are folk figures we only encounter in the Alpine regions of Bavaria and Austria. According to various sources, their name probably derives from the legendary character “Perchta” (also: “Berchta”). If you pay close attention, you will notice there are actually two different types of Perchten: the “good” Schönperchten and the “evil” Schiachperchten, whose masks are especially scary. Their artistically carved masks, incidentally, have all been made by hand. Members of both groups of Perchten each carry one or more bells, intended to help drive away the winter.\nAccording to tradition, Perchten only appear during Twelvetide between winter solstice on 21 December and Epiphany on 6 January. Nowadays, however, Perchten runs take place throughout December. Perchten marchers from Gastein are known to have paraded during a visit of Emperor Ferdinand I back in 1837. No surprise, then, that Gastein Perchten have been proud members of the UNESCO World Intangible Heritage List since 2011.\nThe folklore “boom” of the 20th century also resulted in the distinction between Krampus and Percht become more and more blurred. We even see the development of so-called “Krampusperchten”, along with the birth of numerous local groups, known as “Pässe”, celebrating the tradition. There are around 200 such Pässe in Salzburg alone.\nLiving Tradition\nIt is said that, at every Perchten parade, there is actually one real Percht in the masses. And when you observe these wild characters from a safe distance, as the many lights reflect off their creative masks, you sometimes do have to take a second look: Did I just see an ear twitching there? Or was it just the wind? Isn’t there always some kernel of truth to every legend? Now, Percht, Krampus, the Krampusperchten and the witches have already passed us by. But we will be lining the streets again next year, as the Pässe parade by, provoking occasional shrieks from spectators. And perhaps then we will be able to pinpoint precisely which one of the Perchten is “the real thing”.\nOverview of all Perchten and Krampus events\nKrampus run in Getreidegasse 03.12.2024\nKrampus run at Hellbrunn Advent Market 04.12.2024\nKrampus run in Linzergasse 05.12.2024\nKrampus run in the Old Town 05.12.2024\nTraditional Krampus run at the Salzburg Christmas market 05.12.2024\nNikolo and Kinderkrampus at the Salzburger Christkindlmarkt 06.12.2024\nKrampus day at Hellbrunn Advent Market 08.12.2024\nMaxglaner Krampus run 08.12.2024\nTraditional Perchten run 21.12.2024\nKrampus run in Salzburg | © www.christkindlmarkt.co.at \nKrampus run in Salzburg | © www.christkindlmarkt.co.at \nRadecker Pass, Bergheim | © Radecker Pass, Bergheim \nRadecker Pass, Bergheim | © Radecker Pass, Bergheim \nNikolaus and Krampus | © www.neumayr.cc / www.christkindlmarkt.co.at \nNikolaus and Krampus | © www.neumayr.cc / www.christkindlmarkt.co.at \nBarmstoana Perchten Hallein | © Barmstoana Perchten Hallein \nBarmstoana Perchten Hallein | © Barmstoana Perchten Hallein \nBarmstoana Perchten Hallein | © Silke Leitner \nBarmstoana Perchten Hallein | © Silke Leitner",

    "text": "“Silent Night” is a Christmas Eve tradition – around the globe. At our Silent Night communities here in Salzburger Land, the story behind the world’s most beloved Christmas song is brought vividly to life. Roam in the footsteps of its creators, Franz Xaver Gruber and Joseph Mohr!\nProbably the world’s most popular Christmas carol\nDefinitely a hit song: “Silent Night” has been translated into more than 300 languages and dialects – making it one of the world’s most popular songs ever. It was first performed on December 24, 1818 at St. Nicholas’ Church in Oberndorf near Salzburg. The text was penned by Salzburg clergyman Joseph Mohr, while the melody was composed by Upper Austrian teacher Franz Xaver Gruber. A special distinction: since 2011, “Silent Night” has been listed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List.\nSilent Night Landmarks in Salzburg City\n“Silent Night” fans find additional clues to the history of the song in Salzburg itself, the city where Joseph Mohr was born. Joseph Mohr grew up at No. 31 Steingasse, and he was actually christened over the same font as Mozart, in Salzburg Cathedral. He attended the Lyceum (today, Salzburg University and the Great Hall). The young student earned a little additional income by performing at St. Peter’s Benedictine Abbey. Later, he entered the religious seminary located on Makartplatz Square. Salzburg Museum displays a manuscript by Mohr, upon which he confirmed that he had, indeed, written “Silent Night” in 1816.\nOn the traces of Joseph Mohr\nA musical journey through Salzburg\nNumerous towns and villages in Salzburg have ties to the story of “Silent Night”:\nOberndorf: The Silent Night Memorial Chapel stands at the site where the song was performed for the very first time. The Silent Night Museum recounts the history behind the song. Christmas wishes can be sent to your personal bringer-of-gifts at the Silent Night Post Office.\nArnsdorf near Oberndorf: It was here that Franz Xaver Gruber composed the melody to “Silent Night” at the schoolhouse. He was also sacristan at the pilgrimage church there. Today, the schoolhouse is home to a museum.\nMariapfarr: As a curate here, Mohr wrote the poem “Silent Night” in 1816. Be sure to visit the Silent Night Museum with its nativity scene (1750) and reconstructed “Mohr Room” as well as the parish church!\nWagrain: Mohr spent the last eleven years of his life in Wagrain. The Joseph Mohr Memorial Organ in the parish church, the Joseph Mohr Room at the Waggerl House as well as his grave, all remind us of this cherished parish priest.\nHallein: This “City of Salt” was yet another important place in the life and work of Gruber, and also where he died. His former home in the Silent Night District houses a museum, while his grave lies right outside.\nWhat are the song’s shared roots with Upper Austria and Tyrol?\nThe “Silent Night” towns of Hochburg-Ach and Ried im Innkreis have close ties to teacher and composer Franz Xaver Gruber. In Steyr, the earliest-known version of the song in print was published.\nIt was from the “Silent Night” towns of Fügen and Hippach in Zillertal that the “Nationalsänger” singers came, who made the song internationally famous. One of them, Ludwig Rainer, grew up in Zillertal, and, after his musical tours which took him around the world, made his home in the Achensee region.\nSpecial anniversary celebrations during 2018\nIn 2018, Salzburger Land, Tyrol and Upper Austria celebrated the 200-year anniversary of this famous Christmas song together. A special exhibition at the Salzburg Museum, a musical play at the Felsenreitschule as well as Salzburg’s traditional Advent Singing all dedicated themselves to the same theme. If you would like to learn more about how the song came to be written and how it grew to be famous in every corner of the globe, you will find complete information online at www.stillenacht.com.",

    "text": "The name von Trapp is inextricably linked with Salzburg, where the world-famous family choir was established with its success story and music travelling around the globe.\nThe von Trapps come to the Town of Salzburg\nIn 1923, Georg Ritter von Trapp, an officer in the former Imperial and Royal navy and recently widowed, moved into a villa in the Aigen neighbourhood of Salzburg with his seven children, where they all lived for the next 15 years.\nA new wife and mother: Maria von Trapp\nWhen his nine-year-old daughter Maria began to fall ill, the widower turned to the abbess of Nonnberg Abbey in search of a tutor. She found him twenty-year-old governess Maria Augusta Kutschera, who was contemplating joining the Benedictine order. Just two years later, on 26 November 1927, the father of the family married his maid, who was almost 25 years his junior. They would have three children together.\nThe world-famous choir is established\nIn 1935, von Trapp lost his entire fortune due to bad speculation by his bank. This meant that the family had to rely on renting out parts of the house and performing concerts. Together with the children and house chaplain Franz Wasner, the proactive Maria established the Trapp Chamber Choir. Encouraged by soprano Lotte Lehmann, the young choir entered the folk singing competition at the Salzburg Festival in 1937 and promptly won first prize.\nThe family emigrates to the United States\nIn 1938, after Austria's Anschluss to Hitler's Germany, Georg von Trapp received a draft order to join the German navy. His dislike of the National Socialists and his refusal to accept an invitation to Hitler's birthday party prompted the family to travel to St. Georgen near Bruneck in South Tyrol and then via London to the USA. The Trapps then settled in Stowe, Vermont. From there The Trapp Family Singers would spend 20 productive years touring the American continent, Australia, the Fiji Islands and Hawaii.\nThe legend of the Trapp family lives on in the famous cult film The Sound of Music (1965), which was mainly filmed in Salzburg. You can explore the original locations on a stroll through the town or on a Sound of Music tour.\nThe Trapp Family Singers \nThe Trapp Family Singers \nThe wedding of Maria Augusta Kutschera and Baron Georg von Trapp | © Trapp Family Lodge Stowe/Vermont USA \nThe wedding of Maria Augusta Kutschera and Baron Georg von Trapp | © Trapp Family Lodge Stowe/Vermont USA \nThe Trapp Family Singers | © Salzburg Museum \nThe Trapp Family Singers | © Salzburg Museum \nEmigration of the Trapp Family on the „Normandie“ | © Trapp Family Lodge, Stowe/Vermont USA \nEmigration of the Trapp Family on the „Normandie“ | © Trapp Family Lodge, Stowe/Vermont USA \nThe Trapp Family Singers | © Trapp Family Lodge, Stowe/Vermont USA \nThe Trapp Family Singers | © Trapp Family Lodge, Stowe/Vermont USA \nThe Trapp family today - Trapp Family Lodge\nIn the 1940s, the Trapps constructed a mountain residence in Stowe, Vermont.

Particularly the city mountains, on either side of the River Salzach, afford the opportunity to slow down. Numerous pilgrimage paths lead through Salzburg and are the very definition of the maxim “the journey is its own reward”. Peace can also be found in neighboring towns and villages, many of which are themselves pilgrimage destinations.\nLeft Side of the Old City\nThe Festungs- and Mönchsberg extend elegantly through the left side of the Salzburg historic district. A walk along and alongside these mountains will lead you past places of unusual natural and spiritual power. Not surprisingly, then, numerous religious orders are based in the heart of the Old City and along this particular route. Simply follow the silence, accepting our invitation to catch your breath and discover the peace you crave.\nRoute:\nPast Nonnberg Convent – along the mountain to the Stupa – continuing to the grounds of the Pallottines – then to the pilgrimage church in Mülln. Alternatively, set out from St. Peter’s and ride the fortress funicular up the mountain.\nTip:\nSpend your stay in Salzburg at accommodations provided by the Benedictines or Pallottines!\nRight Side of the Old City\nSt. Sebastian’s Cemetery was built in the style of an Italian \"campo santo\", providing a final resting place for members of the Mozart family, Paracelsus and Wolf Dietrich, as well as a welcome oasis for those in search of quiet reflection. Just a few steps away is the Kapuzinerberg, home to a Capuchin monastery as well as idyllic forests. A wonderful escape for visitors, right in the heart of the city.\nRoute:\nSt. Sebastian’s Cemetery on Linzer Gasse – then to the Capuchin monastery – followed by a walk up the mountain to the Franziskischlössl\nTip:\nFrom the Franziskischlössl, the Bastei-Weg will bring you to a sculpture park at Schloss Arenberg, then via the quiet Steingasse back to your original starting point.\nThe journey is its own reward: pilgrimages\nPilgrimages are some of the oldest traditions in Christianity. Whilst spiritual self-discovery may not be commanded by today’s church, pilgrimages are actually growing in popularity. Salzburg boasts five pilgrimage churches: Maria Loreto and Mülln Parish Church, as well as the pilgrimage churches just outside the city in Maria Plain, St. Leonhard and Grossgmain. In addition, five different pilgrimage paths invite you to pursue your need for personal contemplation.\nPilgrimage Paths through Salzburg City",

It extends a total length of 500 meters: northwards from the Festungsberg, along the left bank of the River Salzach to Mülln. It measures 508 m at its highest point.\nThe Mönchsberg is capped by a plateau of meadows and woodlands; one reason it is such a popular recreation area for locals as well as a destination for tourists.

In addition to the monastery, you will find Imbergkirche church as well as the Hettwerbastei (an excellent lookout point), with its unique view of Hohensalzburg Fortress and the historic district on the opposite side of the river. \nThe Kapuzinerberg and its fortifications\nThe 400-year-old defensive walls along the flanks of the Kapuzinerberg, beginning at the Felixpforte, enclose the Capuchin monastery and run the entire western, southern and eastern flanks of this rocky outcropping. Standing at the northern end of this bastion is the \"Franziski-Schlössl\", built under Prince-Archbishop Paris Lodron in 1629. Originally constructed purely for defensive purposes, it was turned into a tavern back in 1849, since when it has served as a popular excursion destination and refreshment stop. The path up to the Franziski-Schlössl leads along enchanting hiking paths, through the forest and even on the fortifications themselves.\nIn addition to the Franziski-Schlössl, the \"Paschinger-Schlößl\" at No.5 Kapuzinerberg is also well known. From 1919 to 1934, famous author Stefan Zweig lived here. A bust above the villa commemorates the famous writer. A second bust, a few meters farther up the mountain, depicts this city’s most famous genius: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\nCity hikes, climbing and chamois\nFor rock climbers, the steep north face of the Kapuzinerberg provides an excellent opportunity: Use of the so-called \"City Wall” fixed-cable climb is permitted from July until March. Climbing activities are not permitted during the remaining months since this is also a protected habitat for birds during nesting season. Then, outdoor sports fans can take full advantage of a different form of outdoor recreation, in the form of those city hiking paths which lead up and over the Kapuzinerberg. \nWith a little bit of luck, while you are exploring the Kapuzinerberg you might also catch sight of some of the chamois that live there. This colony of wild chamois is unique worldwide and appears to feel extraordinarily at home on the rocky outcroppings of the Kapuzinerberg. Salzburg’s city forester is also a gamekeeper and, in that capacity, does what he can to ensure these animals continue to thrive. \nThree Paths up the Kapuzinerberg\nvia the Imbergstiege stairway from Steingasse (Route...)\nfrom the Franziskustor gate in Linzergasse (Route...)\nfrom Fürbergstraße in the north-east, then up the Doblerweg (Route...)\nYou may also be interested in\nCity hike up the Kapuzinerberg mountain\nCity Hiking",

Hohensalzburg Fortress as well as the baroque palaces and churches testify to the unmatched splendor. An extended walking tour of the DomQuartier impresses both with views of the cathedral district as well as insights into the wealth of the prince-archbishops.\nThe baroque Soul of the city\nImpressed by the opulence of papal Rome, the prince-archbishops wanted to breathe fresh new life into the city of Salzburg. To do so, they brought the greatest architects of the day to Salzburg. Good reason, then, why baroque Salzburg is often referred to as the “Rome of the North”. The magnificent buildings of those times still shape much of the city skyline we see today.\nFortress, Castles & Palaces\nThe history of the biggest and most famous palaces in Salzburg always leads us back to the prince-archbishops. Schloss Hellbrunn and Schloss Klessheim were built as pleasure palaces for their entertainment and amusement, Schloss Mirabell provided a home for the lover and children of Wolf Dietrich, while the Alte Residenz was the official seat of the archbishops’ rule. The state rooms of the Residenz as well as the princes’ chambers in the fortress provide ample evidence of the opulence and riches of this church state.\nMuseums with clerical reference\nOpened in 2014, the DomQuartier – in the heart of Salzburg’s historic district – quite literally provides a complete perspective on Salzburg as the seat of the prince-archbishops. The ancient walls, broad city squares and countless treasures in the rooms and galleries allow you to immerse yourself impressively in the history and stories associated with the prince-archbishops and the church. Highlights of the tour include being able to step out onto the cathedral terrace and look out across the airy plazas, as well as stand up in the choir gallery of the cathedral and gaze down at this baroque masterpiece.\nChurches everywhere – at the foot of Salzburg’s city mountains\nA walk across our local mountains treats you to a complete panoramic overview of Salzburg. As you stroll from Nonnberg Convent, via the fortress to the Museum der Moderne, then to the Mülln section of town, for example, the array of churches before your eyes will frankly astonish you. With the imposing Old City ever present at your feet, you will catch sight of one extraordinary church structure after another. This is an easy, free walk that truly allows you to appreciate the imposing dimensions of the former church state.",

The interplay of tradition and innovation is a top priority.\nThe Success Story \nSince the brewery was established back in 1492, the unique Stiegl-Märzen has been a popular beverage and an integral element of Salzburg’s beer culture. Originally brewed in downtown Salzburg, the bottling plant for their hops classic relocated to the Maxglan section of Salzburg towards the end of the 19th century. The brewery continues to be located there, privately owned for more than 120 years by the Kiener family. Beer fans can learn more about the history of brewing and how beer is produced at a guided tour at Stiegl-Brauwelt. \nDid you know? Even Mozart was a true lover of the delectable “barley juice” produced under the Stiegl label. \nBrewing craftsmanship raised to perfection – this is the promise of the Stieglbrauerei, further underscoring the high quality of Salzburg’s beer-brewing tradition. In addition to the tried-and-true brewing process that goes into producing the “Stiegl-Goldbräu” Märzen beer, including a 12-degree original extract, the brewers place great store in use of regional raw ingredients as well as in sustainability. Particular noteworthy is their incorporation of pure, untreated spring water from a well located deep below the Untersberg. \nStiegl-Brauerei - Außenaufnahme | © Neumayr \nStiegl-Brauerei - Außenaufnahme | © Neumayr \nStiegl- Brauerei | © Stiegl-Brauerei \nStiegl- Brauerei | © Stiegl-Brauerei \nStiegl-Brauerei - Kessel | © Rita Newman \nStiegl-Brauerei - Kessel | © Rita Newman \nStiegl-Brauwelt\nBräuhausstraße 9\nTel. +4350 1492-0 ",

Since 1901, wheat beers have been brewed in innovative ways and to the highest quality standards here in Schallmoos.\nSalzburg’s most famous Weissbier\nAdelbert Behr is generally regarded as the founding father of Salzburg’s Weissbier tradition. Back in 1900, at his small brewery in Schallmoos, he began brewing the first light wheat beer, the starting point for what would become a fabulous success story. To this day, the beer produced by “Die Weisse” is brewed in strict adherence to the original recipe, standing proudly and impressively alongside the other representatives of Salzburg’s beer culture. \nTradition meets Innovation\nAside from focusing on traditional brewing artistry, “Die Weisse” also values progress and ongoing development. With their introduction of the first gluten-free organic wheat beer in 2015, the team which surrounds Felix Gmachl filled a gap on the international market. The bottle featuring a swing stopper guarantees a secondary fermentation process which makes their Weissbier quite unique, responsible for the characteristic fruity aroma as well as the fine-beaded head. \nIf you want to enjoy one of their brews in an authentic setting, there is nowhere better than the brewery’s own traditional inn or in the shaded beer garden. \nDie Weisse in Salzburg | © Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nDie Weisse in Salzburg | © Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nWeißbier von der Weissen | © Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nWeißbier von der Weissen | © Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nSudwerk in der Weissen | © Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nSudwerk in der Weissen | © Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nFelix Gmachl, Die Weisse | © Valentin Weinhäupl Photography \nFelix Gmachl, Die Weisse | © Valentin Weinhäupl Photography \nDie Weisse | © Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nDie Weisse | © Die Weisse / Valentin Weinhaeupl Photography \nDie Weisse - Salzburger Weißbierbrauerei\nRupertgasse 10\nTel. +43662 872246 ",

Even as you make your way along Hellbrunner Allee towards the palace, the experience is equally unforgettable. And as you gaze out across the palace park, you will barely be able to grasp how far this green oasis extends.\nHellbrunner Allee\nThe most beautiful way to approach Hellbrunn is via Hellbrunner Allee. This lane is 400 years old, making it the oldest of its kind in the world today. It is about 2.5 kilometers long and runs through a protected green belt. It was constructed at the order of prince-archbishop Markus Sittikus, who wanted to be able to enjoy a nice straight drive from the city out into the countryside. An impressive 621 trees flank this noble avenue, alongside which also stand a number of distinguished homes and buildings. Hellbrunner Allee is closed to traffic, adding to the enjoyment for walkers, runners and cyclists.\nImportant Buildings alongside Hellbrunner Allee:\nSchloss Freisaal stands amid its own pond.\nGwandhaus, home to Gössl Trachten and a restaurant.\nSchloss Frohnburg served as a shooting location for “The Sound of Music” and is owned by Mozarteum University.\nHellbrunner Allee and Hohensalzburg fortress | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH / K.

This idyllic location with a magnificent view of Hohensalzburg Fortress and the grounds and palace of Hellbrunn, is home to the Monatsschlössl – originally built as a hunting lodge for Prince Archbishop Markus Sittikus in 1615. Since 1924 it has been home to the Salzburg Museum, a small but informative cross-section of the town's history, with a collection of folkloristic exhibits well worth a visit. \nDomestic culture and popular religion \nElaborately painted ornamental rustic furniture from the Leyrerhof in Gries im Pinzgau documents the transition from Rococo to the empire in Salzburg's rustic furniture art. Within the Central European region, the unmistakeable individuality and style of these \"Pinzgauer Blankholzmöbel\" [Pinzgau natural wood furniture] from the 18th century are of the highest quality. Monastic works, the iconographically remarkable oil painting of the \"Holy Trinity\", the large Rauris Lent scene, reverse glass paintings, religious protection and healing remedies and last but not least the \"Totenbretter\" [memorial boards], which are typical for Salzburg, document the spiritual/religious life of the local population of long ago. \nCustoms and traditions \nFigurines with traditional costumes from the individual regions of the province of Salzburg are displayed in the so-called \"Grosser Saal\" [great hall] on the second floor of the Folklore Museum. Here the viewer is also introduced to the most important customs of the Province: \nthe carrying of the Prangstangen [ornamental procession poles] in the Lungau \nthe Krampus parades \nthe Trestern [harvest dancers] in Pinzgau \nthe Glöcklerlaufen [procession of ornate folk figures with bells] \nin Flachgau In terms of their size alone, the figures of Samson from Lungau with his dwarf companions and the Pongauer Schönperchten with their elaborate headdresses are among the special attractions of the museum in the Monatsschlössl.

Unique features include its tall Gothic tower with characteristic helm and double-lantern spire. \nHistory \nMülln Parish Church stands on historic ground: Even back in pre-Christian times, this hilltop above the banks of the River Salzach in the Mülln section of Salzburg was a site of pagan worship. A chapel consecrated to the Virgin Mary is believed to have stood here as early as 1048. Over the years, the chapel became too small, which is why construction of a Late Gothic hall church began in 1439. A consecration ceremony was held here in 1453. \nArchitecture and Interior\nMülln Church underwent its final exterior remodeling during the Late Baroque: The modest entrance gives practically no hint of the magnificence that awaits visitors within. Two lions’ heads adorn the church portal, while the hall is dominated by a mighty high altar made of red marble. It contains a precious, and purportedly miraculous statue of the Madonna with Child, a Late Medieval masterpiece from 1460. Other eye-catching features include a splendidly adorned pulpit as well as a two-story music gallery, whose balustrades extend the entire length of the room. \nMülln Church today\nThe idyllic cemetery dating back to the year 1453 – known as \"Heaven’s Terrace\" - is also worth a visit, having reopened to visitors in May 2017 after almost 140 years. Located on roughly 3000 m² right next to the Müllner Kirche, it affords breathtaking views of the UNESCO World Heritage historic district. In addition to the cemeteries of St. Peter’s and St. Sebastian’s, Mülln is the third of the city’s historic resting places. For 500 years, the monks who had lived in the monastery were laid to rest in the columbaria here. Also located in the cemetery, the Chapel of the Cross from 1709 once served as a chapel of visitation. The ceiling decorations of the chapel are by Josef Schmidt, the Baroque altar by Johann Michael Greiter. \nDaily 8 am- 6 pm (summer until 7 pm)\nMass:\nTuesday, Thursday, Saturday 6 pm\nSunday 10:30 am\nNo visits during mass!\nThe Mülln Church does not provide barrier-free access.\nMüllner Steg in front of Mülln Chruch | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

It’s hard to imagine Salzburg without popular works of art to be found in such a wide variety of locations around the town. Furthermore, the works of art in the gardens of Arenberg castle, the Leube Sculpture Path in Grödig and the new summer project at Schlosspark Hellbrunn are also well worth a visit!\nModern art in a baroque gem\nThe UNESCO-protected Old Town impresses visitors with several venerable and historically relevant buildings – without denying the significance of modern sources of inspiration.

On the one hand, the two locations of the Museum of Modern Art (“Museum der Moderne”) at the Rupertinum and the Mönchsberg are very much a focal point for contemporary art.

In 1953, Oskar Kokoschka founded the \"School of Vision\" at Hohensalzburg Fortress, the oldest academy of its kind in Europe. Today, the “Summer Academy of Fine Arts” serves as an educational institution and platform for around 300 participants from more than 50 countries every year. Over the last 60 years, Salzburg has produced a wealth of contemporary art and culture that is quite beyond compare.

It was the first summer art academy on European soil and today trains around 300 course participants annually. Throughout the city, you will encounter artworks by teachers and students of the Summer Academy.\nThe Vision of the Summer Academy\nThe goal of the Summer Academy has been to create an international place of encounter for people of different heritages, social backgrounds and ages. Oskar Kokoschka promised his students that he would not “train them to become painters, but rather open their eyes for what art is”. Whereas the lessons were originally focused on painting, over time courses were added in fields that included sculpture, graphic art, architecture, fashion, design, performance, set design and photography.\nFacts, Figures and Big Names\nThe courses, of which there are 21 different ones, are held either at Hohensalzburg Fortress or at the Kiefer Steinbruch in Fürstenbrunn. Though other temporary course locations are also available. Over 300 artists and students of art as well as interested laypersons from over 40 different countries take part in the Summer Academy every year. Instructors since 1953 have included such renowned names as Oskar Kokoschka, Kiki Kogelnik, Christian Ludwig Attersee, Valie Export, Robert Jungk, Hermann Nitsch, Günther Schneider-Siemsen, Clemens Holzmeister, Günther Domenig, Gustav Peichl and many more.\nProgram Overview 2024\nFrom 22 July to 31 August 2024, 19 courses will take place at Hohensalzburg Fortress and one course at the Fürstenbrunn quarry. The programme reflects current trends in contemporary art and revolves around making audible in 2024. Practices such as performance, music, radio and film will be used. \nOpen Studios\nAt the Open Studios, interested parties can immerse themselves in the extraordinary atmosphere of the various art laboratories with free admission. On offer are also tours, film presentations, performances and talks.\nThe International Summer Academy of Fine Arts in the Salzburg Magazine\nArt without borders: Sophie Goltz\nThe renowned Salzburg International Summer Academy of Fine Arts is considered the oldest institution of its kind in Europe – an academy which focuses on art, regardless of previous education, age or gender.

    "text": "As one of the co-founders, until his emigration Max Reinhardt held the reins of the Salzburg Festival firmly in his hands.\nFrom actor to father of the Festival\nMax Reinhardt was born 9.9.1873 in Baden near Vienna as Maximilian Goldmann. He celebrated his Salzburg debut as an actor in 1893. However, his services to the Salzburg theater world culminated in his efforts, along with Hugo von Hofmannsthal, to create the Salzburg Festival.\nMemorandum for a Festival Hall\nIn Reinhardt’s vision, the Festival was a reaction to the destruction of the First World War. Furthermore, he felt that art ought to help Austria find a new identity after the demise of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1917, Reinhardt published his “Memorandum for construction of a festival hall in Hellbrunn”. Though this was never built, the first Festival did take place in 1920. On temporary stages and, of course, on Cathedral Square – in keeping with Reinhardt’s desire for an open-air festival.\nReinhardt at the Salzburg Festival\nWith Reinhardt’s production of Jedermann in 1920, the Salzburg Festival was officially born. Many other productions would follow. Reinhardt remained director of the Festival until 1937, before emigrating to the United States. He died in New York on 31.11.1943. He also gained fame for founding the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna as well as his contributions to the development of modern directing techniques. In the Festival District, the Max-Reinhardt-Platz is named after him.\n“Lord of the Castle” in Leopoldskron\nYet another location in Salzburg reminds us of the great director: In 1918, he bought Schloss Leopoldskron and the Meierhof which belongs to it. Reinhardt turned the estate into a gathering spot for Europe’s “Bohemians”, while the castle also provided a venue for stage productions. In addition, he had a garden theater built, which sadly no longer exists. One highlight: the library which Reinhardt established.\nPortrait from Max Reinhardt | © Wikipedia / Nicola Perscheid \nPortrait from Max Reinhardt | © Wikipedia / Nicola Perscheid \nFurther information:",

    "text": "Loretokirche\nChurch of St. Maria Loreto\nDespite its unobtrusive façade, the Loretokirche – a church close to Mirabell Gardens serving the nuns of the Capuchin Order – has a small surprise in store. Its interior is famous for its holy paintings, and especially for the so-called Loretokindel dating from the 17th century. \nLasting Impressions: The Loretokindel \nLoreto Church welcomes many visitors at all times of day. This is due, on the one hand, due its central location close to Mirabell Gardens on Paris-Lodron-Straße. On the other, those in search of peace and reflection find themselves surrounded by a number of holy paintings, including that of Maria Loreto in the right side-chapel. The Loretokindel also sees a constant flow of visitors and is venerated for its purportedly miraculous powers. This small, only 11 cm-tall ivory carving of Jesus dates from the 17th century. It is clad in a jewel-encrusted cloak that was made by nuns from the convent. Pilgrims from near and far come in order to press the figure against their head.\nConstruction History\nLoreto Church in Salzburg has a long and storied history that extends all the way back to the turmoil of the Thirty Years War. The nuns of the Loreto Convent in Landshut were compelled to flee to Salzburg in 1632. By Archbishop Paris Lodron, they were granted permission to build a convent, the cornerstone of which was laid in September 1633. The convent houses 30 cells for the use of nuns. \nSurviving the Upheavals of War\nWhen the French occupied Salzburg in 1800, the convent was used as a barracks and munitions depot. Just six years later and the convent was threatened by dissolution. In order to avoid this, the nuns decided to begin feeding the poor, and they have operated a soup kitchen for the needy ever since. In an air raid during the Second World War, the church was hit by bombs and heavily damaged. However, Loreto Church was rebuilt and re-consecrated in 1946. \nChurch service:\nSundays and Holidays 6:30 am, 8 am\nWorkdays 6:30 am, 8 am\nNo visits during mass!\nVisits of the \"Loreto-Kindel\" (little ivory-made jesus):\nSundays and Holidays 8:45 am-9:30 am and 3 pm-3:30 pm\nWorkdays 8:30 am-10 am and 3 pm-4 pm\nSaturdays and the day before holidays: 8:30 am-10 am and 3 pm-3:30 pm\nFatima day (13th of every month) additionally: 5:30 pm-6:30 pm\nentrance - Paris-Lodron-Strasse | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

The dominant dome, the sweeping façade, the twin towers and the palatial side wings are absolute eyecatchers on Makart Square. \nConstruction History\nThe church was built thanks to the efforts of Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun, who wished to create a lasting home for the theological seminary. The mighty structure was erected between 1694 and 1702. The architect drew upon the creations of Roman architects as models for his own church, which was also connected to the seminary itself. Particularly noteworthy are the new baroque elements introduced by Fischer von Erlach, which may also be observed at his other churches in Salzburg. The Church of the Holy Trinity became especially famous for its dome fresco by Johann Michael Rottmayr, depicting the coronation of Mary and the Holy Trinity. \nLasting Impressions: The Anliegenbuch\nIn its interior, visitors will find the so-called Anliegenbuch or “Book of Concerns”, where they have the opportunity to write down their worries and wishes.

At that time, a tunnel for the Almkanal was cut through the Mönchsberg to supply the city with water. Directly at the exit of the canal from the mountain, the monastery built a grain mill and also the bakery that is still appreciated today as St Peter's Abbey Bakery. \nWood-fired bread and baked goods \nWith its historic vaults, the Abbey Bakery presents itself rich in history. The extremely popular wood-fired bread made from pure natural sourdough is still baked in the original wood-fired oven. The bread keeps well and paired equally well with butter and jam as it is with cheese and ham. Other classics of the traditional bakery are mini brioches and Vintschgerl [aromatic rye and wheat bread from South Tyrol]. \nProduct range: original St Peter's wood-fired bread, various baked goods \nWorth seeing: directly next to the entrance to the bakery, the mill wheel at the Almkanal was rebuilt according to old models. \nStories about Stiftsbäckerei St. Peter in the Salzburg Magazine\nHandcraft & Tradition\nThe Daily Bread of Salzburgers\nSalzburg to take home: shopping for sustainable souvenirs\nMonday*, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday 7 am-5 pm\nSaturday 7 am-1 pm\nFresh bread from approx. 8:45 am (Monday, Tuesday) or 7:45 am (Thursday-Saturday)\nClosed: Wednesday, Sunday\n* January/February: also closed on Mondays\nSt. Peter Stiftsbäckerei | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nSt. Peter Stiftsbäckerei | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nMühle St. Peter Stiftsbäckerei | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nMühle St. Peter Stiftsbäckerei | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH, Breitegger G. \nStiftsbäckerei St. Peter | © A.R.T. / P.

    "text": "Lasting Impressions: Scala Santa\nA unique feature of the Cajetan Church is the Sacred Stairway, built in 1712 in imitation of the Scala Santa in Rome. Worshippers may only ascend this staircase on their knees, a practice that evokes a common expression of piety during the Baroque era. Just like its role model in Rome, crosses were installed on the 2nd, 11th and 28th steps, symbolizing the drops of blood shed by Jesus Christ. The cross on the 2nd step has unfortunately been lost, only the empty casing still remaining. This stairway actually represents a particular honor bestowed upon Salzburg, since it is not merely a replica. Rather, it is an off-shoot of the original that is equally as holy. The stairs are open every Saturday from 11 a.m. to noon.\nIn 1591, Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich purchased an infirmary along with a church, in order to found a theological seminary that would be run by the Theatine (Cajetan) Order. The church was not completed until 1696 under the reign of Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun, finally consecrated in the year 1700. When the Salzburg chapter of the Theatine Order was dissolved in 1809, the Cajetan Church also came precariously close to falling into decay. In 1923, the church and the monastery were transferred to the Order of the Brothers of Mercy, who made every effort to ensure that the church was maintained and rehabilitated. During the Second World War, the building served as a military hospital and was damaged in a bombing raid. However, it was subsequently restored. \nArchitecture and Interior\nConstruction of the Cajetan Church also heralded the arrival of the Italian Baroque in Salzburg. The broad, palatial façade treats the church and monastery as a unified architectural complex. It also features a mighty oblique-oval dome which underscores the sacred character of the building. \nThanks to the stuccowork, the church interior has a festive, stately and pure appearance. The dome, which permits abundant natural lighting, dominates the space. Built into the gallery above the atrium is the oldest preserved organ in Salzburg, made in 1700 by Christoph Egedacher.",

From the pulpit, you can enjoy an overwhelming view over the rooftops of Salzburg.\nThe “Trompeterschlösschen” and the Capuchins \nIn the Middle Ages, a fortified tower known as the “Trompeterschlösschen” was located on the Kapuzinerberg, at the site of today’s Capuchin Monastery. When Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietric von Raitenau brought the Capuchins to Salzburg in 1594, he decided to transform this tower into a monastery with a church, which would then serve as the future home of the order.\nThe Path to the Capuchin Monastery\nMany paths lead up the Kapuzinerberg. If you begin your climb from the Linzer Gasse, the path will lead you past six baroque chapels depicting Stations of the Cross, concluding with an impressive Crucifixion group. Yet another path to the monastery leads via the Imbergstiege, past St. John’s Chapel. Coming from the north-east of Salzburg, you can reach the Capuchin Monastery by following the Doblerweg from Fürbergstraße – also taking you past the Franziskischlössl.\nThe Capuchin Monastery\nDespite its own modest architecture, the Capuchin Monastery is visible from afar due to the bastion before it and a towering cross. The inner portal, whose Late Gothic oak door is reputed to come from the old Salzburg Cathedral, is particularly impressive. In contrast, the monastery church is rather simple, inviting visitors to sit in quiet contemplation.\nMonday-Saturday 6 am-6 pm (summer until 8 am)\nSunday 8 am-6 pm (summer until 8 am)\nNo visits during mass!\nKapuzinerkloster mit Stefan-Zweig-Büste | © Tourismus Salzburg / K.

    "text": "Wallfahrtskirche Maria Plain - Pilgrimage Church Maria Plain\nMaria Plain, which is located to the north-east of Salzburg City, has been a beloved pilgrimage destination since the 17th century. The famous pilgrimage church, the Mount Calvary and the verdant nature all around never fail to captivate visitors, hikers and pilgrims. \nHistory\nThe story of Maria Plain goes back to the times of the Thirty Years War. In 1652, the purportedly miraculous painting \"Mary with Baby Jesus\" by Rudolf von Grimming came to the Plainberg outside Salzburg, where it was kept in a wooden chapel. After barely a year, the original painting had to be returned. However, because of the constant influx of pilgrims, a copy of the picture was made and housed in a new chapel. In 1671, Archbishop Max Gandolf decided to construct a large pilgrimage church. Built according to the plans drawn up by Giovanni Antonio Dario, the church was consecrated on 12 August 1674. Two years later, they were also successful in bringing the original painting back to Salzburg.\nArchitecture and Interior\nThe three-story façade with two towers was modeled after Salzburg Cathedral, even though it is very much in keeping with the character of a pilgrimage church you might encounter out in the country. The church of Maria Plain on the Plainberg is visible from far away. The church’s interior is filled with a golden aura, underscored by tones of blue and white. Maria Plain’s famous painting is the focal point of the high altar itself. \nMaria Plain and the Mountain Cavalry \nThe Mountain Calvary on the southern slope of the Plainberg was built in the 17th century. One of only two in all of Salzburg province, it consists of four chapels leading to a crucifixion group.\nMozart and Maria Plain \nDue to their sense of profound piety, the pilgrimage church of Maria Plain was very close to the Mozart family. This was also the reason why Mozart enthusiast Johann Evangelist Engl assumed that Mozart composed his work, the “Coronation Mass”, for a festival to crown the famous painting at Maria Plain in 1779. To this day, an annual performance of the work does honor both to the painting as well as Mozart’s genius.\nMaria Plain today\nMaria Plain is an attractive destination for pilgrims, with their climb to the top of the Plainberg rewarded by magnificent panoramic views of Salzburg City and the surrounding mountains. Pilgrims and trekkers exploring the Austrian stages of the Way of Saint James as well as the Arnoweg likewise pass by Maria Plain. This pilgrimage destination also provides one of the most beautiful wedding settings in Salzburg. \nmore Information about Maria Plain...\npilgrimage church Maria Plain and Mount Calvary | © Tourismus Salzburg \npilgrimage church Maria Plain and Mount Calvary | © Tourismus Salzburg \nview at the City of Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg \nview at the City of Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg \npilgrimage chruch Maria Plain | © Albin Niederstrasser \npilgrimage chruch Maria Plain | © Albin Niederstrasser \nMaria Plain in the evening | © Tourismus Salzburg \nMaria Plain in the evening | © Tourismus Salzburg \nWallfahrtskirche Maria Plain\nPlainbergweg 38\n5101 Bergheim \nTel. +43662 450194-0 \nConsent for missing marketing cookies",

This Salzburg treasure is best enjoyed as part of \"Music at Mirabell\".\nWhat is so special about this church? \nBesides the grand marble staircase and the magnificent marble hall, the palace church is one of the highlights of Mirabell Palace. Decorated entirely in white and gold and with walls entirely covered in marble stucco, the palace chapel exudes noble elegance. The magnificent high altar (1722) reaches up to the dome and is made of grey and pink marble. \nHow old is the palace church? \nMirabell Palace was built by Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau in 1606, when there was also a chapel in the palace. In the course of major alterations in the 1720s, the basis for today's church was created. In the town fire of 1818, the chapel was partially destroyed and had to be rebuilt. \nThe Mirabell Palace Church is only open during church services and concerts.\nMass: Sunday 10:30 am\nThe church provides barrier-free access from the Mirabellplatz entrance (not from the Mirabell palace courtyard). \nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 01.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 02.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 03.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 04.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 05.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 06.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 07.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 08.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 09.12.2024\nSalzburger Klassik \"Musik im Mirabell\" 10.12.2024\nEntrance | © Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nEntrance | © Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar room | © Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar room | © Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar - Detail | © Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar - Detail | © Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar | © Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nAltar | © Stadtgemeinde Salzburg \nSchlosskirche Mirabell\nSchloss Mirabell, Eingang 1, Mirabellplatz\nTel. +43664 5770872 ",

St. Erhard was a contemporary of Salzburg's patron, St. Rupert Rupert. Of Irish/Scottish heritage, St. Erhard was known as a miraculous healer of the sick and protector of the poor.\nArchitectural history\nIn 1689, the new Erhard Church was completed on the site of a small chapel, designed by the young architect Giovanni Gaspare Zugalli. In 1727 a cemetery was laid out opposite the church, but it was abandoned in the mid-19th century. In 1853 St Erhard's became a parish church and has remained so to this day. In its uniform Italian Baroque style, St Erhard's is one of the most remarkable sacred buildings in Salzburg.\nArchitecture and interior\nThe church is a masterpiece of Salzburg architecture originating in a period that was dominated by the Italian baroque style with all its extravagance, joy of life and wealth of colour and ornamentation. Its special features include the dome crowning the two square towers of the façade, the double flight of steps and a wall fountain with a lion's head gargoyle. The water was said to come from a mineral spring with purifying and life-giving properties. \nThe interior of St. Erhard's Church is characterized by rich colours and elaborate decoration by the brothers Francesco and Carl-Antonio Brenno. The painting on the high altar depicts \"The Baptism of St. Ottilia by St. Erhard,\" painted in 1692 by Johann Michael Rottmayr. The spacious high altar, embellished with stucco marble, is the work of the sculptor Andreas Götzinger.\nThe figures sculpted in the high relief represent Salzburg's three founding bishops, St. Rupert, St. Vitalis and St. Virgil, as well as St. Martin of Tours. The four cardinal virtues, prudence, fortitude, temperance and justice, are attributed to the four bishops.\nDaily 8 am-7 pm\nMass: Sunday 9 am\nThe St. Erhard's Church does not provide barrier-free access.

    "text": "Christuskirche\nProtestant Church Christuskirche\nLuther's doctrines also spread throughout Salzburg at the beginning of the Reformation. The cornerstone for the Christ Lutheran Church was laid on the banks of the Salzach in 1863. \nArchitectural history\nThe construction of the church was financed by generous donations from the Protestant world. 370 prisoners held captive in the Fortress during the Austro-Prussian War against Denmark helped build the church. It was consecrated in September 1867. The brick building on Elisabethkai was the first Protestant church in the Province of Salzburg.\nArchitecture and interior\nThe church is the product of the historicizing architecture representational of the stimuli and synthesis of former styles developing into an independent style of its own. It is the only example of romantic historicism found in Salzburg today. With its balanced proportions, a blend of the Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance styles, and the colorful change from the muted red building to the light grey ornamentation, the church gives a picturesque overall impression. The architect was especially proud of the high steeple and mighty balustrade, visible from afar. \nThe interior of the Christ Lutheran Church is austere, consistent with its sole purpose of preaching the word of the Gospel. The portrayal of Christ as a teacher and ruler is supplemented by symbols of the four Evangelists. Two paintings on both sides of the chancel portray events from the history of Protestantism in Salzburg: the oath of allegiance taken by Protestant farmers in Schwarzach and the Lutheran Expulsion in 1732. The beautiful stained glass window in the chancel was made by Albert Birkle in 1950. It expressively portrays Christ as a Good Shepherd with the lamb and the two Apostles, Peter and John. The lower part shows the Protestant emigrants in their traditional Salzburg costumes. \nThe Christ Lutheran Church today\nConcerts and other events are held at the church regularly.\nThe Christ Lutheran Church provides barrier-free access.

On one wall the artist has mounted twelve delicately slender figures cut from sheet metal illuminated by candles. In the flickering light they cast shadows onto the wall, and the apse is filled with the revolving projection of a shadowy angel of death. At the same time, the sound of the looped recording of an automatic speaking-clock echoes through the room. \nA harmony of time and space\nThe artist's shadow play is a modern \"Danse Macabre\", with time passing audibly as one observes it. Through his artistic intervention, Christian Boltanski has transformed the historical space into a site of mystery, which unites the spirituality of his art with the sacred aura of the church.\nMonday-Saturday 10am - 5pm, Sunday and public holiday 1pm - 5pm.

Its sacred spaces also host the original “Salzburger Advent®”.\nHistory \nThe original St. Andrew’s Church used to stand on the Platzl, but ultimately had to be demolished to make way for a wider road. The new Andräkirche was built in Neo Gothic style on Mirabellplatz and was consecrated in 1898. During the Second World War, the church was partially destroyed in a bombing raid. A few years after the war, they began rebuilding the church in a more simplified form. 1969/70 saw a major remodeling: The towers were shortened and capped off with flattish pyramid-shaped roofs, while the front of the church acquired a light-grey and white coloration.\nArchitecture and Interior\nThe interior of St. Andrew’s Church in Salzburg reflects the modified pietistic style of today, characterized by few accent features. In contrast to this, the church interior is dominated by the high altar, the crucifix, as well as windows dedicated to the Virgin Mary as well as the figures of other saints. The décor is further enhanced with fourteen modern paintings depicting the Stations of the Cross as well as a fresco of St. Chrisopher by Franz Fuchs. Yet another addition to the Andräkirche came at the beginning of 2017: an original French organ from the year 1890.\nSt. Andrew’s Church today\nEvery Thursday morning, a popular weekly market is held right next to the Andräkirche – known as the “Schranne”.

    "text": "Salzburg Festival\nChronicle\nHugo von Hofmannsthal\nThe annual performances of “Jedermann” are a constant reminder of one of the co-founders of the Salzburg Festival: Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The writer made immense contributions to the Festival, and not only through his mystery play.\nEarlier Salzburg Connection \nAustrian poet, essayist and dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal was born in Vienna on 1 February 1874. He had a Salzburg connection even in his younger years: He would spend his summer holidays in Fusch (Zell am See) and in the Salzkammergut. Salzburg City served as a meeting place with his friends and acquaintances.\nRole in the founding of the Salzburg Festival\nThe idea of creating a festival for theater and music was sparked within Hofmannsthal’s circle of friends. Which makes Hofmannsthal, along with director Max Reinhardt, writer Hermann Bahr and composer Richard Strauss, one of the founding fathers of the Salzburg Festival. In 1919, he published his vision in broad terms: The Festival in Salzburg would help overcome Austria’s identity crisis after the end of the First World War and the dissolution of the Habsburg empire.\nThe Festival Classic “Jedermann”\nIt was also Hofmannsthal’s idea to perform a play in front of Salzburg Cathedral. Actually, this honor was bestowed upon “Jedermann” quite by chance. Originally, a different mystery play had been intended for the purpose: However, Hofmannsthal’s \"Das Salzburger Grosse Welttheater\" had not yet been completed by the time the first Festival opened in 1920. And so it was that “Jedermann” – with just a few years interruption – became a permanent annual highlight of the Salzburg Festival.\nA key Festival force until the very end\nA performance of “Das Salzburger Grosse Welttheater” did eventually have a role to play, opening the new Festspielhaus in 1925. Hofmannsthal continued working to develop the Salzburg Festival until his death. He passed away on 15 July 1929 in Rodaun near Vienna. The City of Salzburg honored him by naming a street after him: Hugo-von-Hofmannsthal-Strasse in the Parsch section of town.\nLearn more about Hofmannsthal’s most famous work “Jedermann”!\nHugo von Hofmannsthal | © Wikipedia \nHugo von Hofmannsthal | © Wikipedia \nEveryman infront of the Salzburg Cathedral, 1920 | © Salzburger Festspiele/Foto Ellinger \nEveryman infront of the Salzburg Cathedral, 1920 | © Salzburger Festspiele/Foto Ellinger \nWikipedia",

One special highlight is St. Sebastian’s Cemetery – a veritable treasure in the very heart of Salzburg.\nHistory and Special Features\nThe history of St. Sebastian’s Church goes back to Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach. He had the church built between 1505 and 1512. In the 18th century, the church – which had since become derelict – was demolished and replaced by a hall church reflecting the style of the Late Baroque. Special features of St. Sebastian’s Church include the magnificent Rococo portal and an impressive gate separating the entrance porch from the main nave. The high altar is adorned by a wonderful Madonna with Child from the year 1611.\nModern Reconstruction \nThe devastating fire in 1818 – which also destroyed broad swaths of the right historical district – didn’t spare St. Sebastian’s Church either. The ceiling fresco and the painting at the high altar depicting St. Sebastian both fell victim to the flames. Restoration of the church began in the early 19th century: Charred baroque paintings were replaced by those of contemporary artists, while the confessionals also acquired a more modern form.\nSt. Sebastian’s Cemetery and its Treasures \nPrince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau had the cemetery designed in the style of an Italian campo santo between 1595 and 1600. Members of Salzburg’s most prominent families as well as famous personalities found their final resting place amid the cemetery’s magnificent arcades. These include Mozart’s father, Leopold, Wolfgang’s wife, Constanze, as well as her second husband, Georg Nikolaus. Since 1564, the passageway leading to St. Sebastian’s Cemetery has also been home to the tomb of famous physician Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, better known as \"Paracelsus\".\nThe most magnificent of all the sepulchers stands proudly in the middle of St. Sebastian’s Cemetery, the Gabriel Chapel, mausoleum of Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich. It was built according to the plans of Elia Castello, and remains one of the architectural masterpieces associated with this famous ruler.\nDaily 9 am-4 pm (summer: until 6:30 pm)\nWinter: access to the cemetery only from the Bruderhof.\nNo visits during the mass!\nBarrier-free access to the cemetery from Linzer Gasse (to the right of the church) via ramps, otherwise several steps. \nSt. Sebastian's Church & Cemetery | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

    "text": "Mozart and Hagenauerplatz \nSalzburg’s Hagenauerplatz is named after the Hagenauer family, a dynasty of local businessmen. The so-called “Hagenauer Haus” at No. 9 Getreidegasse also belonged to the Hagenauer family, who in turn rented out the house to the Mozart family. It was here that, in 1756, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart came into the world. \nThe Griestor \nHagenauerplatz essentially interrupts the Getreidegasse on one side, whilst on the far end it leads out through the Griestor gate towards the River Salzach. This was originally the site of the \"Oberes Tränktor\" in the city wall, a gap providing access to ships on the river as well as an opportunity to water cattle. The former \"Wirtshaus zum Löchl\" at No. 2 Hagenauerplatz dates back to the 16th century and is known today by the name “Zum Eulenspiegel”. Over the years, a number of tiny shops have also established themselves in the Griestor. \nArchitectural masterpieces \nThe house which stands on the corner of the Getreidegasse and Hagenauerplatz was first mentioned back in the year 1334 and is one of the true masterpieces of Salzburg’s rich architectural history. One of the most opulent merchants’ homes of the Late Middle Ages, it draws lots of attention, not least because of its oriel, which extends all the way up to the third story. From 1816 to 1917, this corner house was the location of Gasthaus and Hotel zur Goldenen Krone.\nNeptune Fountain and the Fish Market \nin the 16th and 17th centuries, the Salzburg Fish Market was held on Hagenauerplatz. Water which flowed from the Neptune Fountain located there was used to clean the fish. Due to the stench and the refuse created, the fish market was ultimately relocated to Ferdinand-Hanusch-Platz. The Neptune Fountain also found a new home, on Max-Reinhardt-Platz in the Old City, in front of the Grosses Festspielhaus.",

This narrow, ancient shopping lane curves gently from the Alter Markt to the Waagplatz and was, until 1498, the center of the Jewish community in Salzburg. \nOrigin of the street’s name\nThe name has historic significance: The oldest chronicled mention of a Jewish community in Salzburg dates back to the year 1284. We also know that the Judengasse was the hub of Jewish life in the city from the Middle Ages until the Jews were expelled from Salzburg in 1498. Furthermore, as one of the oldest thoroughfares in Salzburg, it also had an important commercial function. \nThe houses and their histories\nA number of houses on Judengasse remind us of the turbulent history of Salzburg. A synagogue was once located at house No. 15, while No. 3 Judengasse has a very special facade featuring the only purely Jugendstil doorway in Salzburg. \nThe Judengasse today\nThe Judengasse is one of the most popular Shopping streets in the Salzburg historic district. Aside from modern boutiques and international fashion labels, you will also find finest chocolates, souvenirs, home furnishings, along with Easter and Christmas decorations sold year-round.\nJudengasse in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

    "text": "Kapitelplatz & Kapitelschwemme\nAnyone walking to the fortress, the funicular or to St. Peter's Cemetery will cross Kapitelplatz (Chapter Square). The spacious square is bordered on the south by the Cathedral, by the Cathedral provostry and archiepiscopal palace in the east, the novice's wing of St. Peter's Monastery in the west and the Cathedral Chapter's mills.\nChapter Square \nChapter Square was once the site of the Cathedral Abbey: the high clergy resided on Chapter Square and in the palaces in the adjacent streets until the archbishopric was dissolved in 1803. The Cathedral district was comprised of austere, sovereign residences lined up on Kapitelgasse, Kaigasse and Chiemseegasse. \nChapter Fountain\nSlightly secluded from the spacious square, Chapter Fountain bears witness to the past: a horse pond was already situated in the center of Chapter Square during the Middle Ages. The new fountain was built under Archbishop Leopold Firmian in 1732 to plans by Franz Anton Danreiter, obviously modeled on Roman fountains. The ramp used by the horses to access the water leads straight up to the group of figures: Neptune, god of the sea, holding a trident and crown, mounted on a seahorse spurting water. The baroque figure was sculpted by Josef Anton Pfaffinger. A chronogram with Archbishop Firmian's coat of arms can be found above the niche. \nChapter Square today\nChapter Square is a place of concentrated activity in Salzburg's Old City: people playing a game of chess with oversized chess pieces, a number of colorful sales booths and Sphaera, a work of art by Stephan Balkenhol, fill the square with life.\nChapter fountain & Hohensalzburg Fortress | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

The goldsmiths and artisans who lived there gave the romantic lane its name.\nGoldgasse today \nA few centuries ago, Salzburg’s Goldgasse was a hub for the businesses of numerous artisans here in Salzburg. While the focus has shifted in more recent times to folk fashions, leather goods, wines and antiques, the Goldgasse has lost none of its historical charm.\nHouses and their history \nThe houses of the Goldgasse in Salzburg, most of which are 5 to 6 stories tall, have done their part to shape the character of the historical district. Strolling along this lane, attentive pedestrians may well catch sight of some true works of art: including house signs that beseech the saints for blessing and protection, such as a depiction of the coronation of Mary (No. 9 Goldgasse) as well as Saints Florian and Sebastian (No. 16 Goldgasse), and even a replica of the miraculous carving of Altötting together with an angel’s head (No. 6 Goldgasse).\nWe wish to draw particular attention to the Reitsamerhaus (No. 5 Goldgasse), a house which was first chronicled back in 1424. It was at this house that in 1700 French merchant Jean Fontaine first received a license to serve coffee. Later, this coffeehouse moved to the Alter Markt, where, now Café Tomaselli, it continues to captivate its guests with sweet temptations and a variety of brews. \nGoldgasse | © Tourismus Salzburg \nGoldgasse | © Tourismus Salzburg \nGoldgasse - view to Residenzplatz | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

Its roots go back to the 12th century. \nFormer civic hospital church \nAs early as 1185, a chapel in honour of St. Blaise was built near the Gstättentor. In 1330, a church was built there which was closely connected to the Bürgerspital [civic hospital]. This name was given to the adjacent hospital because the citizens of the town provided for the physical well-being of those in need of care. St. Blaise is considered an advocate and patron saint of the sick. \nThe special features of the church \nSt. Blaise's Church was the first hall church built in Salzburg whose nave and aisles were of equal height. The church interior is Gothic, and separated by an ornate rococo lattice. The real gem of the church is a delicate late-Gothic sacrament shrine (around 1460), which probably once served as a reliquary. It has the form of an elaborately designed filigree church with a small oriel. The unusual classicist high altar dates from 1785. \nVisit St. Blaise's church \nThe former oratory of the church is now largely partitioned off and serves as a venue for concerts and Advent serenades under the name \"Gothic Hall\". The area of the former Bürgerspital also includes the inner courtyard of the Admonter Hof, which now houses the Toy Museum. \nDaily approx. 8 am-5:45 pm (entrance area only).\nHoly Mass Tuesday-Friday, Sunday and public holiday 6:15 pm\nSt. Blasius | © Kirche St. Blasius \nSt. Blasius | © Kirche St. Blasius \nSt. Blaise's Church | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

It was here, in the heart of today’s Festival District, that parade horses from the prince-archbishops’ stables used to be washed off and groomed.\nHerbert von Karajan Square\nRight at the foot of the Mönchsberg cliffs, Sigmund’s Gate opens out onto Herbert von Karajan Square and Salzburg’s historic district. The square was named after famous Salzburg-born conductor Herbert von Karajan. It was he who founded the Salzburg Easter Festival in 1967 and the Salzburg Whitsun Festival in 1973. \nThe Horse Pond\nThe Horse Pond on today’s Herbert von Karajan Square was designed and built in 1603 by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. It was originally used as a place to wash the parade horses of the prince-archbishops. The statue of the “Horse Tamer” and the unique frescoes on the back wall of the Horse Pond evoke some of the customs of that time. \nFor fans of the Hollywood movie “The Sound of Music”, Herbert von Karajan Square is a must-see.

    "text": "The origins of the Sigmund-Haffner-Gasse \nBuilt back in the year 1140, Sigmund-Haffner-Gasse is one of Salzburg’s oldest streets. It is named after a prominent merchant and former mayor of the city: Sigmund Haffner. Prominent residents of the Sigmund-Haffner-Gasse included Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, his beloved Salome Alt as well as composer Heinrich Biber. \nHouses and their history \nThe house at No. 4 Sigmund-Haffner-Gasse 4 is known to have already been an inn back in 1607. In 1800, it was rechristened the “Gasthof zum Elefanten”. The name actually refers to an elephant by the name of “Soliman”, which the Portuguese king gave to Archduke Maximilian of Austria and his bride on the occasion of their wedding. \nThe Ritzerhaus was first chronicled in 1294. Back then, it was part of the city walls, and therefore right on the very edge of the Old City. In 1620, a small gate was built here, which led to the gardens once tended by the nuns of St. Peter’s Convent. Today, it is a thoroughfare from Sigmund-Haffner-Gasse to the Universitätsplatz and known as the Ritzerbogen. Also located in this same building since 1492 is Austria’s oldest bookshop. \nSigmund-Haffner-Gasse today \nLocated on Sigmund-Haffner-Gasse is Museum der Moderne Rupertinum, a museum of modern art and one of Salzburg’s cultural highlights. Once used as a seminary for aspiring priests, the building has been publicly owned since 1983, since when it has housed modern works of art as well as graphics collections. In addition, the numerous private galleries, one-of-a-kind shops and cozy restaurants along Sigmund-Haffner-Gasse invite people to pause, relax and enjoy.",

As of the 15th century, this square functioned as a hay and bread market. \nThe history of the square\nThe name “Waagplatz” dates back to the time when the official scales of the city (“Waage”) stood in the middle of the square and were used to weigh out grain. If you go even farther back in history, you do come across accounts of public executions here as well. And it was not until the beginning of the 17th century that the public pillory was moved to the Griesgasse. \nBirthplace of Georg Trakl \nThe Schafferhaus at Nos. 1a and 2 Waagplatz, with its two courtyard wings and a rear building, mainly dates back to the 16th century. The three-story arcades are particularly noteworthy. The facade we see today was built in 1860. It was also in this house that, on 3 February 1887, Salzburg poet Georg Trakl was born, the fifth of seven children. Today’s Traklhaus is home to a museum and memorial site dedicated to the famous poet. \nSalzburg Courthouse\nThe house at No.3 Waagplatz is thought to be the oldest courthouse in Salzburg, dating back to before 1328.

    "text": "Steingasse\nSteingasse is one of the oldest streets on the right side of the Salzburg historic district. It runs parallel to the River Salzach at the foot of the Kapuzinerberg, its medieval charm captivating visitors from around the world.\nHistorical background of the Steingasse \nAside from the River Salzach, which was a vital transportation artery for salt – the white gold of the mountains – the Steingasse, which entered the city from the south, also had a very important role to play. It was the most traveled road into the mountains, and to Italy beyond, making it one of the most vital north-south routes for medieval commerce. That said, local artisans and merchants also did business along this narrow city street. Pottery makers, dyers and tanners – in particular, those trades that had the greatest need for water – tended to gather here. Until the flow of the Salzach was regulated in 1862, virtually all of the imposing houses here, most of which stand to this day, had magnificent back gardens and direct access to the river. \nThe Steingasse today\nA stroll through the Steingasse is a leisurely experience, especially in the late morning when the sun illuminates the facades of the old houses so beautifully. Nowadays, there are only a few shops in this street. The wide Imbergstraße has supplanted the narrow Steingasse as a main artery. The houses along Steingasse are now mainly used as residential buildings. Joseph Mohr, the famous poet of the Christmas song “Silent Night”, once lived at No. 31 Steingasse. At the end of the street, we find the so-called “Engelwirtsbrunnen” – an impressive wall fountain made of marble. \nThe Steingasse and the Kapuzinerberg\nThe Steingasse is the ideal starting point for a walk to the top of the Kapuzinerberg. The relatively minimal effort that goes into the hike up there is rewarded by one of the most beautiful panoramic views of the city. Half way up the steps (known as the Kapuzinerstiege or Imbergstiege), somewhat tucked away in a corner is the enchanting small church of St. Johann am Imberg, which the Mozart children frequently enjoyed visiting.\ninner gate in the Steingasse | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

The crooked layout is partly due to the site of a Roman temple, the foundations of which were excavated in the 20th century.

    "text": "A name inseparably intertwined with Salzburg: Herbert von Karajan made the Salzburg Festival the major event on the classical music calendar we know today.\nHerbert von Karajan – a native of Salzburg\nAside from Mozart, this City of Mozart gave birth to yet another great musical talent: Herbert von Karajan, born Heribert Ritter von Karajan on 5 April 1908 in Salzburg. As a music student, he attended the Mozarteum Conservatory. In his later musical career, he shaped and dominated the cultural life of his native city.\nCareer with the Salzburg Festival\nThe Karajan era with the Salzburg Festival began in the post-war years. Because of his prior membership in the National Socialist Party, the Russian occupying forces actually banned him from conducting until 1947. At his Festival debut in 1948, he conducted Gluck’s Orpheus, while in 1957 he directed a performance of Beethoven’s Fidelio. He took over as artistic director in 1956.\nThe “Absolute Ruler” of the Festival\nBeginning in 1960, Karajan no longer served as the sole director. And as of 1964, he was just one member of the Festival directorate. That said, as the “last absolute ruler” – or so his reputation goes – he made all the major decisions. Until his death in 1989, he continued to pull the strings at the Festival.\nAchievements and Legacy\nKarajan’s primary focus was on the musical aspects of the Festival and on internationalizing the event. He succeeded in bringing top-caliber world stars to Salzburg, and with them guests from around the world. In 1960, he opened the newly built Grosses Festspielhaus. In 1967, he founded the Easter Festival; in 1973, the Salzburg Whitsuntide Concerts. In addition, he made substantial contributions in the development of musical documentation.\nWalking in Karajan’s footsteps through Salzburg\nKarajan’s grave at the cemetery in Anif soon became a pilgrimage site for his fans. The memory of this conductor is still kept alive at a number of other Karajan locations in Salzburg. Next to Marko-Feingold-Steg bridge, in the garden in front of the Raiffeisen building – the house where Karajan was said to have been born – there stands a life-size bronze statue of the maestro. Though in fact, he was actually born in a sanatorium on Franz-Josef-Strasse. Salzburg also named a city square – Herbert-von-Karajan-Platz – after their native son. Located, of course, in the Festival District.\nHerbert von Karajan | © Siegfried Lauterwasser \nHerbert von Karajan | © Siegfried Lauterwasser \nGroßes Festspielhaus - Karajan | © Luigi Caputo \nGroßes Festspielhaus - Karajan | © Luigi Caputo \nBirthplace of Herbert von Karajan in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg Gmbh / S.

In order to commemorate that special night, today’s Silent Night Chapel was built and officially opened in 1937 on the very same site as the former St. Nicholas’ Church where it was originally performed. Every year, a memorial service in honor of the song’s creators is held at 5 p.m. on Christmas Eve in front of the Gruber-Mohr monument.\nRight next to the chapel, the old parsonage – where Joseph Mohr had lived from 1817 to 1819 – was turned into the Silent Night Museum. On a total area of 260 m², visitors are treated to a complete overview of the story behind this world-famous Christmas song, including the history of St. Nicholas’ Church, where the song was first performed, as well as milestones in the lives of Joseph Mohr and Franz Xaver Gruber. The astonishing spread of “Silent Night! Holy Night!\" around the globe is yet another theme addressed by the museum.\nA Museum for Big and Small\nMany different multimedia displays make it even easier for visitors to immerse themselves in the story of how this Christmas song was born, including life as it was back in those times. One special highlight is a karaoke station, which gives younger and older visitors an opportunity to personally experiment with various musical and linguistic versions of the song. An educational area on the top floor is also available to host workshops and school visits.\nThe opening hours can be found on the official website.\nStille-Nacht-Museum Innenansicht | © © Standl \nStille-Nacht-Museum Innenansicht | © © Standl \nSilent Night Chapel in Oberndorf | © Eva-Maria Repolusk \nSilent Night Chapel in Oberndorf | © Eva-Maria Repolusk \nSilent Night Chapel in Oberndorf | © Tourismusverband Oberndorf \nSilent Night Chapel in Oberndorf | © Tourismusverband Oberndorf \nStille-Nacht-Museum Außenansicht | © © Hermeter \nStille-Nacht-Museum Außenansicht | © © Hermeter \nStille Nacht Museum Oberndorf\nStille Nacht Platz 7\n5110 Oberndorf bei Salzburg \nTel. +436272 4422 ",

Looking on the building from the outside, the metaphor of a wing comes to mind, exuding incredible dynamics and an absence of gravity - despite the 1,200 tons of steel and 380 tons of special glass that went into its construction.\nArt\nAt Hangar-7, art is not presented obtrusively. Rather, it is blended into the surroundings in a subtle and stylish way. This alone guarantees a unique atmosphere inside the impressive glass dome of Hangar-7, for the exhibited pieces can quite literally be seen in a different light depending on the weather or the position of the sun.\nAt Hangar-7, artists and visitors come together on an equal footing. Although it serves as a meeting place for all art lovers, the term “art gallery” would not do it justice as an exhibition venue. Rather, Hangar-7 is a place where artists and art aficionados can exchange ideas and inspire one another. The exhibition space is brought to life by this exchange, which stimulates the contrast between the different exhibition themes: technology in all its forms on the one side, and the equally varied art on the other.\nTechnology\nThe Flying Bulls in Salzburg are devoted to the art of finding rare historic aircraft, which they refurbish with dedication to let them fly again.\nHangar-7 was opened at Salzburg Airport in the summer of 2003, henceforth the home of the Flying Bulls. A special feature of the Flying Bulls' historic collection: the exhibits are much more than just collector's items. All of the Flying Bulls aircraft, regardless of age, are still airworthy.\nSalzburg Magazine: Soaring high: Hangar-7 \nMonday-Saturday 9 am-10 pm, Sunday 9 am-5 pm \nClosed: 22 December 2023 - 4 January 2024\nVisits for groups: prior arrangement necessary\nDogs permitted only in the exhibition area and in the Carpe Diem Lounge-Café.\n(Status: 05/2024)\nAdmission free \n(Status: 05/2024)\nAll areas within Hangar-7 can be accessed via a barrier-free entrance. \nB25 at Hangar-7 | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nB25 at Hangar-7 | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 Outside | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 Outside | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 in the sunlight | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 in the sunlight | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 Showroom | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 Showroom | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar 7 - Mayday Bar | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar 7 - Mayday Bar | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nLogo Hangar-7 | © Red Bull Photofiles \nLogo Hangar-7 | © Red Bull Photofiles \nHangar-7 | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nHangar-7 | © Red Bull Hangar-7 / Helge Kirchberger Photography \nRed Bull Hangar-7 GmbH\nWilhelm-Spazier-Straße 7a\nTel. +43662 2197-0 ",

The \"Bosna\" prepared there has enjoyed cult status for a long time. \nCult sausage made in Austria\nA unique sausage speciality started its culinary success story at Salzburg's Balkan Grill and has long since become an Austrian classic – although it actually comes from Bulgaria: the \"Bosna\", a kind of hot dog. It consists of grilled pork sausages that are placed between two slices of white bread with onions and fresh parsley as well as a secret spice mixture. \nWorldwide success from Müllnerbräu\nSalzburg has the Bulgarian Zanko Todoroff to thank for the \"Bosna\": in 1949 he prepared a bratwurst in the Müller Bräustübl according to his secret recipe. Thanks to its delicious flavour, it quickly became a well-known delicacy in the city. Soon Todoroff was able to afford his own snack stand, the Balkan Grill. The small stand in the Stockhamer Durchhaus, a passage between Universitätsplatz and Getreidegasse has long since achieved cult status and has even found its way into Asian travel guides. No wonder, then, that numerous Far Eastern guests also join the colourful crowd at the tiny window of the restaurant.\nProduct range: bosna in different variations (e.g. original, onion, parsley, spice or onions, ketchup, spice with mustard, spice etc.). \nSpecial feature: the special style of the take-away window in the courtyard is unique.\nBosna vom Balkan Grill in Salzburg | © zweibaum.at \nBosna vom Balkan Grill in Salzburg | © zweibaum.at \nBalkan Grill in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH \nBalkan Grill in Salzburg | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH \nBosna vom Balkan Grill | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH \nBosna vom Balkan Grill | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH \nSalzburger Tradtitionsbetrieb: Balkan Grill | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH \nSalzburger Tradtitionsbetrieb: Balkan Grill | © Tourismus Salzburg GmbH \nBalkan-Grill\nGetreidegasse 33 a\nTel. +43662 841483 ",

By scaling his sculpture of five gherkins arranged in a row up to human size and by creating the impression that the objects are growing out of the tarmac, Wurm leaves ordinary objects transfused with individuality.

    "text": "The Walk of Modern Art takes visitors to Salzburg's most beautiful places and hidden treasures, and to places where art is least expected. The sculptures are within walking distance of the Old City and freely accessible.\nPublic Art\nThe Walk was initiated by the Salzburg Foundation in collaboration with the Foundation for Art and Culture Bonn as part of a 10-year project entitled \"Salzburg Art Project\". Each year, between 2002 and 2010, the Salzburg Foundation invited an international artist to Salzburg to design and execute a work of art for the public space. With the execution of the 10th and final arts project in October 2011 comprising three works by the acclaimed Austrian artists Brigitte Kowanz, Manfred Wakolbinger and Erwin Wurm, the Walk of Modern Art was completed.\nIn 2013, the artworks (of the Salzburg Foundation) were transfered to the International Würth Collection, where they are now on permanent loan from the City of Salzburg. In 2017 the stone sculpture “berliner block” by Gerhard Trieb was added to the Walk of Modern Art and in 2019 Anselm Kiefer’s “The Language of Birds” completed the art project.\nWhilst every artist had taken a completely different approach, each sculpture is an interpretation of Salzburg and highlights the city's identity as a cultural centre and World Heritage site. All artists had the chance to visit the city and familiarize themselves with its history, culture and architecture before designing and executing a work of art in a public site of their choosing. By presenting their very personal interpretations, this circuit of contemporary art, which is unique in Europe, has evolved.\nIn a town steeped in tradition, it offers visitors and residents the opportunity to engage in an inspiring dialogue with contemporary art. You, too, are invited to search for new answers to new questions and by doing so, experiencing another side of Salzburg.\nPublic guided tours\nGuided tour in German to selected sculptures of the “Walk of Modern Art”\nTo the dates (german)…\nMeeting point: 3 pm, Mozarteum university - inner courtyard\nDuration: 100 min., in all weathers\nFree entrance\nRegistration necessary: artroom@wuerth.at, tel. +43 50 8242-0\nOn your tour through the old city all the sculptures will be visited.

The somewhat hidden-away location of this exhibition allows for an intensive dialogue with the pieces in an open setting. \nArtworks you can touch\nMany of the artworks blend harmoniously with the castle grounds. Others, for their part, are more grotesque, stimulating you to ponder. The materials are every bit as colorful of a collection as the artists themselves. The intentions and possibilities are likewise diverse. The “Modified Social Benches” of Jeppe Hein represent a humorous contribution lying somewhere between furniture and art. On Markus Redl’s “Stone 47”, you are tempted to become part of the object. And Magdalena Jetelová’s “Chair” appears at first sight to be an absurd piece of wood, though is actually a criticism of the media in totalitarian systems.\nThe Würth Collection\nThe Würth Sculpture Park at Schloss Arenberg and the Walk of Modern Art in the Salzburg historic district (since 2013) are expressions of the closeness between Salzburg City and Würth. In fact, the first of this company’s collectors’ pieces were exhibited in the City of Mozart back in 1991.

Verging on romantic, the path follows the banks of the Königsseeache, surprising visitors with artworks and clear messages along the way. \nSpirals, Stairways, Crosses – Art in the Forest\nIt all began in 2008 with the “Tree Spiral”. By 2013, this had been joined by four additional pieces: “Scandal in Paradise” is a shiny red ball hovering above the forest floor. “VOIDS” is a collection of nine concrete crosses, “Come back tomorrow” a free-floating pink staircase without any visible support, while “Pixel Pipe Leonhard 8/8” enthralls with its optical subtleties.\nThe LEUBE Collection\nThe Sculpture Path is located on the grounds of the LEUBE cement plant in St. Leonhard/Grödig. The path of modern art was opened in 2013 to mark the company’s 175th anniversary. The ongoing expansion of the pathway represents the extension of a successful “Artist in Residence” program, which took place from 1995 until 2005. The Tree Spiral at the start of the path, in particular, has close ties to LEUBE: 200 employees and 200 family members from the company planted 400 willow trees around the bust of the company’s founder. \nCome back tomorrow im LEUBE Skulpturenpark | © LEUBE/Herman Seidl \nCome back tomorrow im LEUBE Skulpturenpark | © LEUBE/Herman Seidl \nSkandal im Paradies im LEUBE Skulpturenpark | © LEUBE/Herman Seidl \nSkandal im Paradies im LEUBE Skulpturenpark | © LEUBE/Herman Seidl \nVOID im LEUBE Skulpturenpark | © LEUBE/Herman Seidl \nVOID im LEUBE Skulpturenpark | © LEUBE/Herman Seidl \nBaumspirale im LEUBE Skulpturenpark | © LEUBE/Herman Seidl \nBaumspirale im LEUBE Skulpturenpark | © LEUBE/Herman Seidl \nPixelröhre im LEUBE Skulpturenpark | © LEUBE/Herman Seidl \nPixelröhre im LEUBE Skulpturenpark | © LEUBE/Herman Seidl \nTourismusverband Grödig\nGartenauerstr. 8\n5083 St. Leonhard \nTel. +436246 73570 ",

    "text": "Public Art\nAside from the works of the Walk of Modern Art, there are other forms of “street art” in Salzburg’s historic district. Whether the projects of the publicly funded “Kunst am Bau” or sculptures by Salzburg artists – the Baroque inner-city is optically enriched by these modern elements and Salzburg becomes a vibrant open-air gallery.\nAcclaimed artists in Salzburg’s most beautiful places\nIf you stroll through the city with your eyes open, you will discover countless contemporary elements. Many of these have something to do with Mozart, such as the quotation displayed at the Mozarteum Foundation on Schwarzstraße. Others portray the many prince-archbishops of the city, such as the sculptures by Giacomo Manzú. Touching memorials such as the “stumbling stones” or more scurrilous objects such as the \"SoS\" manhole covers turn this Baroque backdrop into an exciting interaction between past and present.\nThe \"Kunst am Bau\" Initiative\nThe origins of \"Kunst am Bau\" take us back to the 1920s, when the economic circumstances were bad and building projects were intended to generate employment – also for artists. In the 1930s, it was decided that a certain percentage of each public building project had to be dedicated to art. This regulation remained in place until 2008, after which the art aspect was no longer mandatory. However, art, including temporary installations, continued to be subsidized. The artists of these modern features created an elemental connection between their works and the building; be that the façade, the windows, doors or walls. Examples of \"Kunst am Bau\" include the entrance area of the DomQuartier and \"Stimono\" outside the Salzburger Landestheater.",

Hundreds of hip-hop and house dancers display their skills at the Flavourama battle.\nTop European event\nWith participants from 30 nations and more than 3,000 visitors, Flavourama is one of the biggest dance-battle events in Europe. Dancers come to Salzburg to compete in the categories hip-hop and house. In these dance-battles, a DJ sets the music and the participants have to improvise or – in technical terms – freestyle to it. They are judged by a jury of three, who then choose the winners in round called sudden death. All-round offer (also for amateurs) \nIn addition to exciting direct comparisons, the festival offers a comprehensive fringe programme. Workshops, performances, talks and live bands make this dance style accessible to visitors who are not familiar with the hip-hop scene. Particularly interactive are the walking dance classes, which take place in Hallein this year. Those interested walk through the city and learn a choreography step by step. \nFlavourama Hip Hop & House Dance Festival: 1.9. - 8.9.2024 - Program \nDiscover stories about the Flavourama Streetdance Festival in the Salzburg Magazine\nLet's (Street-) Dance: Olivia Mitterhuemer\nCreativity meets zest for life: Urban Dance in Salzburg\nDancers at the Flavourama Batttle in Salzburg | © Flavourama \nDancers at the Flavourama Batttle in Salzburg | © Flavourama \nTwo dancers at the Flavourama Battle in Salzburg | © Flavourama \nTwo dancers at the Flavourama Battle in Salzburg | © Flavourama \nTwo dancers at the Flavourama Battle | © Flavourama \nTwo dancers at the Flavourama Battle | © Flavourama \nWalking Dance Class | © Fräulein Flora \nWalking Dance Class | © Fräulein Flora \nWalking Dance Class at the Flavourama Street Dance Festival \nWalking Dance Class at the Flavourama Street Dance Festival \nWalking Dance Class at the Flavourama Street Dance Festival in Salzburg \nWalking Dance Class at the Flavourama Street Dance Festival in Salzburg \nDancer at the Flavourama Street Dance Festival in Salzburg | © Flavourama \nDancer at the Flavourama Street Dance Festival in Salzburg | © Flavourama ",

    "text": "Museum of Modern Art Rupertinum\nThe location of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg Altstadt at the Rupertinum presents temporary exhibitions of international format on 700 m². This Early Baroque building in the center of the historic district is unmistakable thanks to the “Tongue Beards” of Friedensreich Hundertwasser.\nThe History of the Building\nFirst chronicled in 1350, the building occupies a prominent location between the Franciscan Church and Collegiate Church. Under Archbishop Paris Lodron, the Palais \"Collegium Rupertinum\" served as an educational institution for aspiring priests. The Rupertinum was run as a home for children and students until 1974. \nIn 1983, the building transferred to public ownership as the “Salzburg Museum of Modern Art and Graphic Collection”. Over the years, the rooms of the Rupertinum were adapted and now provide an outstanding setting primarily for graphic art and photography. Major remodeling took place in 2016 and the Generali Foundation Study Center moved into the Rupertinum.\nGenerali Foundation\nThe Generali Foundation comprises around 2100 works by 250 renowned artists and is one of the biggest private collections in Austria. The extensive archives, the library and parts of the collection of the Generali Foundation were merged on permanent loan with the holdings of Museum der Moderne Salzburg and are available free of charge. \nAustrian Photography Collection\nPhotography has been collected at Museum der Moderne Salzburg since 1981. Whereas initially the holdings of Salzburg Province were administered in parallel to purchases by the Austrian Ministry of the Arts, the national collection is now officially known as the “Austrian Federal Photo Collection at Museum der Moderne Salzburg” and comprises around 12,000 individual titles. \nMultimedia guide \nA multimedia guide is now available in the MuseumStars app (for iOS and Android) with a wide range of information and services: \nIntroduction to art in public space \nDigital art walks \nSite plans and orientation aids\nSalzburg Magazine\nMuseum der Moderne Salzburg – one museum under two roofs\nTuesday-Sunday 10 am-6 pm, Thursday 10 am-8 pm (from 25 April 2024)\nDuring the Summer Festival and 26.12.2023-6.1.2024: additionally open Monday 10 am-6 pm\n24 Dec: 10 am-2 pm\nClosed: 25 December\n(Status: 01/2024)\nOne museum - two buildings - five exhibitions\nValid for both the Museum der Moderne Salzburg/Mönchsberg + Altstadt (Rupertinum) including the MönchsbergAufzug Lift and panoramic view.

A particular highlight is the nativity scene with references to Salzburg. \nAn eventful history \nThe beginnings of the former parish church go back as far as the year 800. Until the 12th century, it was a double church: the upper part was reserved for the emperor and his entourage, the lower part was for the bourgeoisie. In the 18th century, it was elaborately redesigned, and now it is integrated into the row of houses of the Residenzplatz to such an extent, that its former appearance is hardly recognisable. \nWhat is special about St. Michael's church? \nThe small church is a succursal church in honour of the Archangel Michael. The main altar is adorned with a painting of the Archangel defeating Lucifer. A further highlight is the all-year nativity scene showing scenes from the ecclesiastical year: from the proclamation of the angel to the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The backdrop of the nativity scene are Hohensalzburg Fortress and the catacombs at St. Peter.\nAltar | © Tourismus Salzburg / S. Siller \nAltar | © Tourismus Salzburg / S.

It represents a male figure on a golden sphere with a neutral expression. This man might be 'everyman'. The same neutrality is reflected in Balkenhol's 140 cm-tall female counterpart, \"Woman in the Rock\". Neither figure tells us its story. They appear to reflect everyday reality, and yet remain emotionless and anonymous. Balkenhol's art invokes a great range of interpretation.

Guided tours of the dam itself treat visitors to insights into the inner workings of the Moosersperre and the ultramodern power generation plant. As an additional highlight, there are countless opportunities to explore the surrounding mountains via hiking paths and an array of fixed-cable climbing trails. \nThe birth of a fascination \nThe first plans for a hydroelectric plant in Kaprun Valley were drawn up in the 1920s and 30s.

There, from May until the End of October, you can enjoy hikes with the whole family.\nHow the Lammerklamm was created \nThe Lammerklamm demonstrates the imposing power of nature. The narrow valley was carved out by glaciers during the Ice Age (approximately 15,000 to 30,000 years ago), while the masses of water released by the melting ice left behind a narrow gorge flanked by steep cliffs. The Lammer river gorge is one of the most impressive natural wonders in all of Salzburger Land. \nHiking in the Lammerklamm \nThe gorge has been accessible to visitors since 1884 and can be explored from May until the end of October. The secured walkways running alongside the rocky walls of the gorge make visits as safe as can be. The path leads down to the torrential waters and to some absolutely beautiful lookout points. A bridge located at a narrow point also allows you to cross over to the far side of the gorge. \nEspecially impressive: the so-called \"Dark Gorge\". Here, the water has eaten extremely deep into the rocky terrain, while the cliffs on either side come within 1 meter of each other, almost seeming to touch. As if standing beneath a roof, all you can hear is the sound of the rushing waters. \nShortly before the end of the Lammerklamm, you will need to cross the \"High Bridge\". Standing 30 meters above the water, you will have an opportunity to look back down the gorge and take in fascinating views of the Tennengebirge mountains.

Once you are there, you will discover a number of appealing highlights, including: ferry service across the turquois lake as well as a ride up into the mountains on a vintage steam railway.\nExciting rides up the mountain on the Schafbergbahn\nThe peak of the Schafberg is really striking, its iconic silhouette fitting perfectly into the idyllic countryside which surrounds Lake Wolfgangsee. The steepest steam-powered cog railway in Austria has run from the town of St. Wolfgang to the top of the Schafberg since back in 1893. The ride up takes 40 minutes, covering a distance of 5.85 kilometers while rising 1,190 meters. Once at the top, breathtaking views of the Salzkammergut and surrounding alpine world reveal themselves to visitors.\nThe SchafbergBahn over the course of time\nThe original rolling stock used by the SchafbergBahn dates back to the end of the 19th century, including cog steam locomotives which are some of the oldest still running anywhere in the world. Today, more modern oil-fired locomotives do the lion’s share of the work. The SchafbergBahn operates daily from April until October. If you want to avoid waiting times, simply book your ticket online in advance.\nAn Imperial Fleet\nIn 1873, regular ferry service on Lake Wolfgangsee was officially “launched” with the maiden voyage of the 33 meters-long paddle steamer “Kaiser Franz Joseph I”. Nowadays, a cruise on this renovated ship is one of those special experiences you won’t soon forget. The fleet consists of a total of six motorized vessels, running daily from May until October as well as on weekends during Advent, in springtime and at Easter. Boat landings are located at St. Gilgen - Fürberg - Ried/Falkenstein - St. Wolfgang Schafbergbahn - St. Wolfgang Markt - Geschwendt (car park) and Strobl.\nsteam-driven rack-railway at Schafberg | © Salzburg AG \nsteam-driven rack-railway at Schafberg | © Salzburg AG \n\"Die Linie Österreich\" at Lake Wolfgangsee | © Salzburg AG \n\"Die Linie Österreich\" at Lake Wolfgangsee | © Salzburg AG \nWolfgangsee Ferries | © Salzburg AG \nWolfgangsee Ferries | © Salzburg AG \n\"Die Linie Salzburg\" at Lake Wolfgangsee | © Salzburg AG \n\"Die Linie Salzburg\" at Lake Wolfgangsee | © Salzburg AG \nSchafberg and Lake Wolfgangsee | © Salzburg AG \nSchafberg and Lake Wolfgangsee | © Salzburg AG \nHimmelspforte am Schafberg | © Salzburg AG \nHimmelspforte am Schafberg | © Salzburg AG \nErlebnis Wolfgangsee Schifffahrt \nErlebnis Wolfgangsee Schifffahrt \nFamilienausflug auf den Schafberg | © Salzburg AG \nFamilienausflug auf den Schafberg | © Salzburg AG \nthe oldest steam-driven rack-railway of Austria | © Salzburg AG \nthe oldest steam-driven rack-railway of Austria | © Salzburg AG \nSchafbergBahn & WolfgangseeSchifffahrt\nMarkt 35\n5360 St. Wolfgang \nTel. +43662 8884-9700 ",

    "text": "Kehlsteinhaus\nThe Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle’s Nest) on Obersalzberg Mountain\nThe Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle’s Nest) on Obersalzberg Mountain in Berchtesgaden is located at a height of 1820m above sea level and is a popular day-trip destination. Originally built by the Nazi Party as a suitably representative venue, the architecturally unique building now features a mountain-top restaurant offering a splendid panoramic view of the area. \nThe Kehlsteinhaus – Then and Now \nThe Kehlsteinhaus, a.k.a. the Eagle’s Nest, was built under the rule of the National Socialists as a gift for Adolf Hitler to mark his 50th birthday. During the Second World War, the building was used for state occasions and government meetings. No bombs or Allied attacks ever impacted the building, allowing it to survive in its original form, right up until today. Since 1960, the Kehlsteinhaus has housed a mountain restaurant, commanding stunning panoramic view of peaks up to 200 kilometres away. \nA Very Special Ascent \nThere is no other road in the world like the one from Obersalzberg to the Kehlstein car park. Although it only has one long bend, the road rises 800m in altitude. Since 1952, the Kehlsteinstraße has been closed to normal road traffic. Ever since that time, a special bus has brought tourists from all over the world up to the Kehlstein car park, where the ongoing journey becomes rather adventurous. A 124-metre tunnel through the solid mountain rock takes guests to a lift, the interior of which is fitted with mirrors and polished brass. In just 41 seconds the lift takes guests up to the interior of the Eagle’s Nest. \nArrival and Details \nThe easiest way to experience the Eagle’s Nest is a guided bus tour that starts in the city of Salzburg. Visitors can also enjoy a foot march offering magnificent views of the Bavarian Lake Königssee, this takes approximately 2 housr. Those seeking a more easy-going means of getting back down can continue the journey by bus. \nThe buses and the lift also transport wheelchairs.\nEagles Nest - Good to know\nThe Kehlsteinhaus - Eagles Nest is expected to be open from the beginning of May until the end of October.\nOnly accessible by Kehlstein bus or on foot.\nThe prices can be found on the official website.\nKehlsteinhaus over the clouds | © TR Berchtesgaden \nKehlsteinhaus over the clouds | © TR Berchtesgaden \nbus | © RVO \nbus | © RVO \nbus terminal | © RVO \nbus terminal | © RVO \nKehlsteinhaus | © TR Berchtesgaden \nKehlsteinhaus | © TR Berchtesgaden \nKehlsteinhaus\nSalzbergstraße 45, Parkplatz Obersalzberg\n83471 Berchtesgaden \nTel. +498652 2969 ",

This unique natural spectacle in the Province of Salzburg is an ideal destination for a family excursion.\nAbout the gorge\nThe gorge – 4,000m long and up to 300m deep – was formed over millennia through erosion by the Grossarler Ache [stream]. In 1875, a generous donation by Prince Johann II of Liechtenstein enabled work to make the Gorge accessible to the public. \nHighlights\nThe route leads into the gorge and back over bridges, walkways and stairs for about a kilometre, past mossy rocks and an imposing waterfall, where in fine weather the sun's rays conjure up rainbows in the spray. The \"Helix\" spiral staircase descending 30m into the depths offers an awesome experience. The hike takes around 1.5 hours. \nHow to get there\nThe Liechtenstein Gorge can be reached from Salzburg by car or public transport. Parking is free.

His \"Mozart\" is neither a historical portrait nor a simple allegory. In the form of a 2.95 metre-high bronze figure, Lüpertz's work combines a naked female torso and a bust of the composer with the characteristic pigtail, posed in classical counterpoise confronting St. Mark's Church as a sculptural opposite. Evoking the genius and inward discord that marked Mozart's life and work, the artist leaves his \"Mozart\" transfused with an ambivalence of male and female, complete and fragmentary. \nVulnerable art\nArt critic Peter Iden points out, that Lüpertz's sculpture is to be seen as reflecting Mozart's music and its impact rather than Mozart as a person.

The rather fragile „Female Dancer“ is positioned in the center of a world famous panoramic view. \nPerfect location for public art\nWith its dwarfs, the Hedge Theater and its antique statues, Mirabell Gardens has always been a home for art. The Rose Hill is likewise adorned by a sculpture: the figure of a naked dancer created by Giacomo Manzú. The dancer, standing on point and stretching skywards, conveys a sense of lightness combined with concentration. The beauty of the statue is underscored by the world-famous gardens and the city panorama. \nThe artist and his love for Salzburg\nGerman publisher Franz Burda gave this statue to Salzburg in 1976, the city where he had met dancer Inge Schnabel back in the 1950s. Franz Burda had very close ties to Salzburg since he had taught at the Summer Academy here for a number of years. It was also here that Burda made the acquaintance of the Italian artist Manzú, himself a big Salzburg fan. Together with Oscar Kokoschka, Manzú was one of the prominent figures of the Summer Academy of Fine Arts. \nGiacomo Manzú in Salzburg\nOther works by Manzú in Salzburg include the big “Door of Love” at Salzburg Cathedral, “The Cardinal” at the foot of the cathedral arches and the figure “Prince-Archbishop Paris Lodron” at the Salzburg University Faculty of Natural Sciences. \nMore information\nPublic Art in Salzburg\nFemale Dancer in the Kurgarten | © Tourismus Salzburg \nFemale Dancer in the Kurgarten | © Tourismus Salzburg ",

    "text": "Art of the Lost Generation\nThis privately run non-profit museum shows the extraordinary collection of Prof. Dr. Heinz R. Böhme. The collection currently comprises around 450 works and tells the stories of artists who were considered \"degenerate\" during the National Socialist era, were persecuted and are largely unknown today.\nExhibitions from the Böhme Collection\nNew works from the Böhme Collection Because they were ahead of zeitgeist of their time, the artists of the Lost Generation, like so many other artists, were suppressed, persecuted and murdered by the National Socialist regime. Unique personalities and works of art were thus left behind and forgotten in the course of history. \nWith this exhibition, the Museum of the Lost Generation aims to highlight the life's work of people who were not recognised during their lifetime. Discover the expressive works of a special generation who did not let themselves be stopped from making their contribution to cultural history as \"degenerates\". \nTuesday-Saturday 10 am-5 pm\nClosed: public holidays, 24 Dec 2023-1 Jan 2024, 7-18 Oct 2024, 24 Dec-1 Jan 2025\nPublic guided tour \"5 for 5\": every first and third Saturday of the month at 3 pm (with advance reservation by e-mail or phone).\nPrivate tours on request\nAdults € 14.00\nSenior citizens (from 65 years) € 12.00\nPupils (from 12 years), students (under 27 years), people with disabilities (ID required) € 8.00\nChildren (under 12 years), Members of the Engagement & Sponsorship Programme free\nFamily (2 adults + children up to 18 years) € 30.00\nPress (only with compulsory pre-registration) free\nPublic guided tour: € 5,00 plus entrance fee\nPrivate guided tour: € 130,00 plus entrance fee\nThe museum provides barrier-free access.
